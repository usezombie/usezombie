//! Hard-purge of a personal account, triggered by a Clerk `user.deleted`
//! webhook (`identity_events_clerk.runDelete`).
//!
//! Deletes the subject's tenant and every dependent row in foreign-key order.
//! `core.zombies`, `vault.secrets`, `core.platform_llm_keys`,
//! `core.zombie_sessions`, and `core.zombie_approval_gates` reference
//! `workspaces`/`zombies` WITHOUT `ON DELETE CASCADE`, so the workspace and
//! tenant deletes hit an FK violation — 500 the webhook and make Clerk retry
//! forever — unless their children go first. Cascade-backed children
//! (zombie_events, integration_grants, agent_keys, api_keys, tenant_billing,
//! tenant_providers) drop with their parent.
//!
//! Per-zombie Redis event streams (`zombie:{id}:events`) are left to expire via
//! their TTL — the same fallback the per-zombie delete path documents when
//! stream cleanup is skipped; the worker no-ops empty streams.
