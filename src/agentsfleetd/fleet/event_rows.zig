//! event_rows.zig — every durable `core.zombie_events` / `core.zombie_sessions`
//! write the runner control-plane verbs make: the received-row INSERT (lease),
//! the terminal-status UPDATE (report), and the session checkpoint UPSERT
//! (report).
//!
//! The received INSERT was lifted from the worker's `event_loop_writepath_rows`
//! at the M80 cutover — it keeps its `*ZombieSession` + `*ZombieEvent` params
//! because the lease verb has a real session + acquired event. The terminal +
//! checkpoint writers were narrowed to the few fields they read (the report
//! path has a `zombie_id` + `event_id` + `ExecutionResult`, never a full
//! `ZombieSession`), so the partial-struct/`undefined` shims the worker forced
//! are gone. Each write is best-effort + logged (non-atomic, mirroring the
//! deleted finalize); row-equivalence with the direct path is the invariant.
