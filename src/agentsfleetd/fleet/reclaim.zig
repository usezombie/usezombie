//! Lease reclaim — re-leasing an expired holder's event from Postgres alone.
//!
//! When `affinity.claim` wins a zombie whose prior claim had expired, the dead
//! holder's still-`active` lease row carries the durable event envelope + the
//! billing context. `reclaimPriorActive` selects that row (locked), marks it
//! `expired`, and returns it in ONE atomic statement, so the caller can re-lease
//! the SAME event under the fresh higher fencing token — no Redis re-read (the
//! envelope is durable in Postgres) and no re-billing (the original lease already
//! debited). If there is no prior active lease the zombie is simply free and the
//! caller takes a fresh event instead.
//!
//! Arena allocator (`hx.alloc`): every returned slice is arena-dup'd and freed
//! when the request ends — see service.zig's module note.
