//! POST /v1/runners/me/leases/{lease_id}/activity — forward live-tail frames.

//! Thin wrapper over the control-plane service. Identity is the runner token
//! (`runnerBearer` populates `hx.principal.runner_id`); `lease_id` is the only
//! runner-verb path param. The service resolves the lease's zombie + event
//! (scoped to the runner) and `PUBLISH`es each frame to `zombie:{id}:activity`
//! for the SSE live tail. Best-effort: a dropped frame is cosmetic, the durable
//! record is `report`.
