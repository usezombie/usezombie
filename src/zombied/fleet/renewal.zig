//! fleet — the `renew` operation: atomically extend a live lease's deadline.
//!
//! Decouples lease liveness from execution duration. A runner that is actively
//! executing an agent calls `POST /v1/runners/me/leases/{id}/renew` inside the
//! renewal window; this pushes the kill deadline forward so a legitimate >30s
//! run is never reclaimed mid-flight.
//!
//! The hard part is that reclaimability is driven by `runner_affinity.leased_until`
//! (the slot `affinity.claim` checks), a SEPARATE row from `runner_leases.
//! lease_expires_at` (the child kill deadline). Renewing one but not the other
//! still gets a healthy run reclaimed at the TTL. So `renew` extends BOTH rows
//! in ONE writable-CTE statement, to the SAME clamped value, guarded by the same
//! live fence `service_report` uses (`fencing_token >= fencing_seq`) plus
//! `status = 'active'`. The check and the two writes share one snapshot — a
//! concurrent reclaim cannot split them. That single-statement atomicity is the
//! whole correctness story: the rows can never diverge.
//!
//! The deadline is clamped to the hard cap `created_at + MAX_RUNTIME_MS` — a
//! wedged-but-emitting agent still terminates. Three terminal verdicts are
//! distinguished for the caller (credit-gating lives in the handler, before this):
//!   - `renewed`     → both rows advanced; the new deadline is returned.
//!   - `max_runtime` → the lease is still ours but the hard cap is reached (010).
//!   - `lost`        → the lease is no longer active/ours (reclaimed or fenced) (011).
//!
//! Runs on a caller-supplied pooled connection (drained via PgQuery).
