//! fleet — the `renew` operation: atomically extend a live lease's deadline AND
//! meter the slice of runtime + tokens consumed since the last renewal.
//!
//! Decouples lease liveness from execution duration. A runner that is actively
//! executing an agent calls `POST /v1/runners/me/leases/{id}/renew` inside the
//! renewal window; this pushes the kill deadline forward so a legitimate >30s
//! run is never reclaimed mid-flight, and charges the elapsed run fee + token
//! delta for that slice.
//!
//! The hard part is that reclaimability is driven by `runner_affinity.leased_until`
//! (the slot `affinity.claim` checks), a SEPARATE row from `runner_leases.
//! lease_expires_at` (the child kill deadline). Renewing one but not the other
//! still gets a healthy run reclaimed at the TTL. So `renew` extends BOTH rows
//! in ONE writable-CTE statement, to the SAME clamped value, guarded by the same
//! live fence `service_report` uses (`fencing_token >= fencing_seq`) plus
//! `status = 'active'`. The check and the two writes share one snapshot — a
//! concurrent reclaim cannot split them.
//!
//! Metering rides that same fenced statement. The `guard` arm gates EVERY write:
//! advance both cursors, debit the wallet (clamped, never negative), accumulate
//! the per-event `stage` telemetry row, and INSERT the per-renewal breakdown —
//! a lost/capped renewal writes none of them. The Δ is computed off the AFFINITY
//! cursor (the durable per-zombie anchor that survives reclaim), so a re-sent
//! renewal charges ≈0 (cumulative-diff idempotency). The four per-unit rates are
//! resolved in Zig (`tenant_billing.resolveRenewSliceRates`) and passed in, so
//! the slice math here is the SAME as `computeStageCharge` — SQL==Zig by
//! construction (free-trial / self_managed / platform are all encoded as rates).
//!
//! Runs on a caller-supplied pooled connection (drained via PgQuery).
