//! contract — the frozen `/v1/runners` wire interface, shared by the agentsfleetd
//! control plane and the host-resident `agentsfleet-runner` daemon.
//!
//! Lives in `src/lib/` and is consumed as a **named module** (`@import("contract")`)
//! by both build graphs, so neither binary reaches into the other's tree to
//! speak the protocol — the only shared surface is what this barrel re-exports.
//!
//!   * `protocol`         — request/response types, wire paths, status values.
//!   * `event_envelope`   — the normalized event on the wire (file-as-struct).
//!   * `execution_policy` — the resolved config + inline secrets on the wire.
//!   * `activity`         — the live-tail progress frame for the `activity` verb.
//!   * `execution_result` — the terminal stage result (runner produces, report consumes).
