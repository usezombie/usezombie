//! Frozen /v1/runners control protocol — the request/response types and enums
//! `zombied` (the control plane) and the host-resident runner exchange over HTTPS.
//!
//! These shapes are the interface the parallel runner workstreams build against;
//! do not change a field without amending the keystone spec. Two conventions
//! hold throughout:
//!   * Identity comes from the Bearer token, never the URL or body. register is
//!     authed by an existing operator/provisioner credential — a Clerk JWT or a
//!     `zmb_t_` api_key, via bearer_or_api_key — and mints the runner_token;
//!     every later call carries that minted runner_token (`/v1/runners/me/...`,
//!     where `me` resolves from the token). No request carries a runner_id —
//!     there is nothing to reconcile.
//!   * Wire enum values are the enum tag names verbatim (std.json renders enums
//!     via @tagName), so the enum is the single source for each value (RULE UFS).
//!
//! The lease payload reuses the canonical execution types so the wire and the
//! runner never drift: the event is the normalized `EventEnvelope`, and the
//! resolved config + inline secrets travel as the runner's own
//! `ExecutionPolicy`. Leases are fenced — see `LeasePayload.fencing_token`.
