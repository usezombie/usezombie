//! Edge/boundary tests for `renew_driver.onTick`: a server-issued deadline at or
//! before `now_ms`, a pathological starting deadline near `i64` min (window math
//! must not overflow/panic), and the supervisor-level timeout that protects a
//! lease when renewal fails transiently on every tick. A scripted fake client
