//! child_supervisor_read.zig — the framed-stdout read loop (parent side).
//!
//! Split out of `child_supervisor.zig` to keep both files within the line
//! budget: this module owns the child→parent message plane — the activity /
//! memory / usage sinks, the renewal hook the daemon installs, and the loop
//! that reads framed stdout up to the terminal `result` frame while driving
//! renewal ticks. `child_supervisor.zig` re-exports the public names so callers
//! and tests keep using `child_supervisor.{ActivitySink,RenewHook,readResult,…}`.
//!
//! One thread runs this loop: frame parsing and the renewal `onTick` never race,
//! so the folded usage snapshot is a plain field (no atomics).
