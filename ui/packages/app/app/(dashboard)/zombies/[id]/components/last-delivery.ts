/**
 * Maps a declared trigger to the actor-glob the events API recognises.
 *
 * Cron triggers all share `cron:*` regardless of schedule — the server
 * does not tag cron events with the specific schedule that fired, so
 * the actor space has no per-schedule namespace to glob against. A
 * zombie with two cron triggers (e.g. every-15-min and hourly)
 * therefore renders the same "last delivery" timestamp on both cards
 * — whichever cron fired most recently. The right place to fix this
 * is the server's cron actor format, not the dashboard's glob.
 *
 * `api` triggers don't carry a stable actor namespace (every webhook
 * ingress shares the bare `/v1/webhooks/{id}` URL), so they opt out —
 * the caller surfaces `null` in the per-trigger map.
