/**
 * signInAs(page, fixtureKey) — establish a Clerk session in the browser
 * for a fixture user without driving the hosted SignIn form.
 *
 * Implementation: the `clerk.signIn` helper from `@clerk/testing/playwright`
 * mints a one-time sign-in-token via the Backend API
 * (`signInTokens.createSignInToken`), then evaluates clerk-js in the page
 * to call `Clerk.signIn.create({strategy: 'ticket', ticket})` and
 * `Clerk.setActive({session})`. The cookies that come out the other side
 * (`__session`, `__client_uat`, `__clerk_db_jwt`) are written by clerk-js
 * itself, so they carry the same shape clerkMiddleware expects from a
 * real interactive sign-in — including the `azp` claim on the session
 * JWT, which a Backend-API-minted default token omits.
 *
 * Why we cannot manually `addCookies` here: the previous implementation
 * minted the `__session` cookie via `POST /v1/sessions/{id}/tokens` and
 * stuffed `__clerk_db_jwt = "fixture-dev-browser"`. clerkMiddleware
 * accepted that on plain GETs but rejected it on the first Server-Action
 * round-trip (current `@clerk/nextjs` warns
 * `Session token from cookie is missing the azp claim`, and at the same
 * time clears `__client_uat` to `0`). The next protected navigation then
 * 302s to /sign-in. The `clerk.signIn` route avoids the entire mismatch
 * because clerk-js mints the cookies the way clerkMiddleware was built
 * to consume them.
 *
 * `setupClerkTestingToken({ page })` runs first to attach
 * `__clerk_testing_token` to every browser-side FAPI call — bypasses
 * CAPTCHA on Clerk DEV (Cloudflare Turnstile is now on by default for
 * the SignUp form) and keeps the testing posture stable across instance
 * config drift.
 *
 * Pre-req: globalSetup ran (`provisionUser` → `bootstrapTenant` → `attachJwt`)
 * and wrote the fixture-JWT cache.
