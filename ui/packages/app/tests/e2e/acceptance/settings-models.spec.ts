/**
 * settings-models.spec.ts — /settings/models renders for an authed user.
 *
 * Asserts the page resolves the active workspace, calls
 * GET /v1/tenants/me/provider (resolved server-side), and renders the
 * "Active configuration" + "Change provider" sections. Does NOT switch
 * the provider mode — that touches tenant state and would race other
 * specs running against the same fixture tenant; the change-flow is
 * covered by unit tests under `lib/api/tenant_provider.test.ts`.
 *
 * Page render alone is a useful signal because the provider resolver
 * has multiple failure modes (synthesised default, credential ref
 * mismatch, backend 5xx) that all surface as visible chrome here.
