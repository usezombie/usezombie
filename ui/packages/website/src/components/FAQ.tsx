  },
  {
    q: "What does BYOK mean?",
    a: "Bring Your Own Key. Store your own LLM provider credential — Anthropic, OpenAI, Fireworks (Kimi K2), Together, Groq, Moonshot — and the executor resolves it at the tool bridge. usezombie marks up zero on inference; you pay your provider directly.",
  },
  {
    q: "What am I actually paying for?",
    a: `Hosted execution. Runs are metered against a credit pool with a ${RATES_DISPLAY.starterCredit} starter grant that never expires. Two debit points: ${RATES_DISPLAY.event} per event receipt and ${RATES_DISPLAY.stage} per stage execution — every wake-up and every reasoning step is line-itemed. Inference cost is yours via BYOK; usezombie marks up zero.`,
  },
  {
    q: "What does 'extras provisioned per workspace' mean?",
    a: "Operational features — multi-workspace, approval gating, workspace-scoped credentials and webhooks, higher concurrency, longer per-stage windows, priority support — turn on per workspace as you scale, not as paywalled tier upgrades. Need bigger caps? Ask; we lift them.",
  },
  {
    q: "Can I self-host?",
    a: "Not in v2. v2 ships hosted-only on api.usezombie.com via Clerk OAuth. Self-host arrives in v3 — the runtime is open source today, and the auth substrate plus KMS adapter are the only deployment-specific layers.",
  },
  {
    q: "Which agent hosts work for the install skill?",
    a: "Claude Code, Amp, Codex CLI, and OpenCode — same skill, same prompts in every host. Run npm install -g @usezombie/zombiectl, then /usezombie-install-platform-ops inside any of them.",

    q: "What if my agent hits the model's context window?",

        It doesn&apos;t lose the thread. usezombie keeps long incidents coherent through three layers
        working together. The runtime watches three signals — a <strong>tool-result window</strong>,{" "}
        <strong>memory checkpoints</strong>, and a <strong>stage-chunk threshold</strong> — and the
        agent responds by compacting tool results into durable memory via{" "}
        <code className="font-mono">memory_store</code>, ending the stage at safe boundaries, and
        re-entering on a continuation chain (capped at 10) for the next stage. Underneath, the agent
        loop runs its own rolling-summary compaction once message count or token budget crosses a
        built-in threshold. Net: a 40-tool-call deploy investigation stays reasoned through to a
        Slack diagnosis, not a context-overflow loop.{" "}
