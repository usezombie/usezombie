 * violations on the current marketing pages (heading hierarchy +
 * missing h1 on /agents, /privacy, /terms). Disabled to keep the gate
 * live for every other axe rule until the marketing-page cleanup pass
 * lands. Each rule should be removed from this list (one PR per rule)
 * as the underlying markup is fixed.
