# Section 4: provision the agentsfleet-runner env file from vault.
# Idempotent. Writes /opt/zombie/.env on the dev worker host with the three
# vars the runner daemon requires (see deploy/baremetal/agentsfleet-runner.service):
#   ZOMBIE_API_URL       — control-plane base URL (literal for dev)
#   ZOMBIE_RUNNER_TOKEN  — pre-minted zrn_ token (Option B; vault: runner-token)
#   RUNNER_HOST_ID       — stable machine id; must equal the minted fleet host_id
#                          (vault: tailscale-hostname = zombie-…-worker-ant)
#
# Pre-Option-B, the daemon self-registered with a zmb_t_ API key and minted
# its own zrn_. Post-Option-B (commit c1ac7343), the platform admin pre-mints
# the zrn_ via POST /v1/runners and stores it under runner-token; the daemon
# authenticates with it directly and never self-registers.
#
# A real zrn_ is minted by a platform admin from the dashboard ("Add runner",
# POST /v1/runners) on the live dev control plane and stored under runner-token.
# This script requires that real token: it seeds both the source /opt/zombie/.env
# (which deploy.sh copies on every CI run) and the unit's EnvironmentFile
# /etc/default/agentsfleet-runner, then restarts and verifies the daemon is active.
# A zrn_FAKE_… placeholder is rejected below; DEV_WORKER_READY stays `false`
# until a real token brings the runner up green.
