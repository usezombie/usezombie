-- fleet.runner_events — append-only runner history for the operator plane.
--
-- `fleet.runners.admin_state` is operator intent and liveness is derived at
-- read time; this table is the durable history of runner lifecycle and work
-- transitions. Event type values are app-enforced enum tags (RULE STS: no SQL
-- CHECK with literal value sets). metadata is JSONB so event-specific details
-- can ride beside the typed event without bloating the current-state row.
--
-- dedup_key is reserved for the liveness sweeper: runner_offline uses the stale
-- last_seen_at snapshot so N replicas racing the same stale runner admit only
-- one offline event.
