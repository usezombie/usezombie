-- fleet.runner_leases — one row per issued lease (zombie-runner split). The
-- control plane (zombied) records a lease when it hands an event to a runner
-- via POST /v1/runners/me/leases, and reads it back at
-- POST /v1/runners/me/reports to reconstruct the write context the direct
-- worker holds in memory. The runner never sees this table; it only echoes the
-- opaque lease id and fencing_token.
--
-- Why these columns: the report handler reproduces the direct worker's
-- finalize() — markTerminal (zombie_id, event_id), recordStageActuals
-- (tenant_id + workspace_id, zombie_id, event_id, posture, model) and
-- checkpointZombieSession (zombie_id). The lease persists exactly that context
-- so report rebuilds it without re-resolving the tenant/provider.
--
-- Event envelope (actor, event_type, request_json, event_created_at): the
-- runner's input event, persisted so an expired lease can be RE-LEASED to
-- another runner from Postgres alone (the durable reclaim source) without
-- re-reading Redis — durable state lives in zombied, never runner-local. Not
-- credentials: secrets are resolved fresh per lease, never stored here (VLT).
--
-- fencing_token: monotonic per lease; frozen here for the later fleet reclaim
--   logic (lease_expires_at + fencing rejection). The control plane records it
--   but does not verify it yet — the single-zombie loopback skeleton has no
--   reclaim path to exercise.
-- status: lease lifecycle — app-enforced values (active | reported | expired),
--   no static-string CHECK (RULE STS).
-- posture/provider/model: the metering posture, the resolved provider name, and
--   the model resolved at lease. provider + model together key the rate row
--   (the same model under two providers prices apart), replayed into the renew
--   credit gate + the report settle.
-- metered_*_tokens/last_metered_at_ms: the incremental-metering cursor. Each
--   /renew charges the diff between the runner's cumulative token counts and
--   these last-metered values (plus the run fee for now - last_metered_at_ms),
--   then advances the cursor in the SAME fenced CTE, so a re-sent renewal
--   double-bills ~0. Initialised at lease issue (metered_* = 0, last_metered_at
--   = issue time) so the first /renew meters off a never-NULL cursor; carried
--   forward on reclaim so the re-leased holder meters from where the dead one
--   stopped (no double-charge, no gap).
