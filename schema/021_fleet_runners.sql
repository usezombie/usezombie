-- Runner fleet control plane (zombie-runner split). The `fleet` schema holds
-- runner identity and — in later migrations — leases, heartbeats, executions,
-- and fleet-level policy/regions. It is deliberately separate from `core` (the
-- tenant data plane) so the control plane and data plane do not share a trust
-- boundary. This matters most for the open-fleet vision where untrusted hosts
-- enroll: their identity never sits in the tenant-data schema. `fleet` is the
-- system boundary; a runner is one instance within it.
--
-- A runner enrolls via POST /v1/runners, authed by an existing
-- operator/provisioner credential (a Clerk JWT or a zmb_t_ api_key, via
-- bearer_or_api_key — there is no enrollment token). register mints a durable
-- per-runner bearer token (zrn_), returned once; this table stores only its
-- hash, and zombied verifies later calls by hashing the presented Bearer
-- (no plaintext token).
--
-- sandbox_tier: isolation strength reported at register
--   (landlock_full | container_nested | macos_seatbelt | dev_none) — values
--   enforced in application code (RULE STS forbids static-string CHECKs).
-- status: runner lifecycle state — app-enforced values, no static CHECK.
-- labels: free-form capability labels, app-supplied JSON array (never NULL).
-- tenant_id: OPTIONAL registration scope. NULL = trusted fleet (secrets ship
--   inline over TLS, the only mode wired today). A non-NULL scope reserves the
--   per-tenant-scoped-runner mode so that vision needn't re-cut this table;
--   ON DELETE CASCADE removes a scoped runner when its tenant is deleted.
-- last_seen_at: liveness bookmark, refreshed on heartbeat.
