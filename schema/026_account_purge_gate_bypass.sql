-- core.zombie_approval_gates is append-only by trigger (schema/009): gates are
-- an operator-facing audit surface, so ordinary write paths must never DELETE
-- them. The two hard-purge paths are the deliberate exception — a personal
-- account erasure (the Clerk user.deleted webhook) and a zombie hard-delete
-- must remove the gate rows, or their workspace/zombie foreign keys abort the
-- purge transaction and the erasure can never complete. Those transactions opt
-- in via a transaction-scoped setting (SET LOCAL zombie.allow_gate_purge),
-- which dies with the transaction; every other DELETE still raises.
