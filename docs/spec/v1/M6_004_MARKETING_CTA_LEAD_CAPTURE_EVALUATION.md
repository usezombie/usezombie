## 1.0 Human CTA Lead Capture Path

**Status:** PENDING

Define and implement a low-friction human-only lead capture path from homepage and pricing CTAs with one primary action (`Notify me`) and durable storage in an external marketing system.

**Dimensions:**
- 1.1 PENDING Replace selected human CTAs with lead-capture action and one-field form or hosted form handoff
- 1.2 PENDING Persist leads with source metadata (`page`, `cta_id`, `plan_interest`, `timestamp`)
- 1.3 PENDING Provide explicit success state (`You’re in`) with no navigation dead-end
- 1.4 PENDING Ensure all human capture links and endpoints are config-driven via environment variables

## 2.0 Agent-Safe Interest Routing

**Status:** PENDING

Separate autonomous agent traffic from human lead capture so machine clients do not pollute marketing lists.

### 2.1 Agent Surface CTA Contract

Agent page keeps machine-oriented actions (docs/webhooks/API interest) and must not submit to human marketing list endpoints.

**Dimensions:**
- 2.1.1 PENDING Remove/avoid human email capture controls from `/agents`
- 2.1.2 PENDING Define agent-specific interest endpoint/flow (`callback_url` or webhook registration) if needed
- 2.1.3 PENDING Add test coverage that prevents human waitlist form rendering on agent route

## 3.0 Evaluation Instrumentation

**Status:** PENDING

Track conversion quality and operational value of captured leads to decide whether to keep third-party hosted flow or migrate in-house.

**Dimensions:**
- 3.1 PENDING Emit analytics events for CTA click, form open, submit success, and submit failure
- 3.2 PENDING Capture campaign attribution fields (`utm_source`, `utm_medium`, `utm_campaign`) when present
- 3.3 PENDING Add weekly export/report path to evaluate conversion rate and lead quality
- 3.4 PENDING Document retention and consent language for marketing follow-up
