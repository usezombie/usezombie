# M84_003: Harden the runner sandbox — clear env, drop caps, no-new-privs, new-session, CLOEXEC proof, absolute argv[0], kill-domain

**Prototype:** v2.0.0
**Milestone:** M84
**Workstream:** 003
**Date:** Jun 03, 2026 (amended Jun 05, 2026 after plan-eng-review)
**Status:** PENDING
**Priority:** P1 — security boundary. Closes a daemon-credential / file-descriptor exfiltration path open to an untrusted sandboxed agent, and pins the containment kill domain. No customer-facing behaviour change; gates untrusted/local-runner General Availability (GA).
**Categories:** API
**Batch:** B1 — standalone security hardening; no concurrent workstream.
**Branch:** {feat/m84-runner-sandbox-hardening — added at CHORE(open)}
**Renumber note (Jun 05, 2026):** filed originally as `M84_001` — that ID is already owned by the shipped `M84_001_..._DASHBOARD_RUNNER_ENROLLMENT` (`docs/v2/done/`, PR #365), and `M84_002` by the pending fleet-operator-plane spec. Renumbered to **M84_003** at plan-eng-review to remove the collision.
**Depends on:** **M82_001 — DONE (merged #366); `std.process.spawn` is on `main` today.** No sequencing wait and no rebase risk: this workstream edits the post-0.16 `forkExec` / `appendBwrap` that already exist. (The original "sequence after M82" framing is obsolete now that M82 has landed.)
**Provenance:** agent-surfaced during the M82_001 `forkExec → process.spawn` Chief Technology Officer (CTO) / threat-model review (Jun 03, 2026), corroborated by an independent CTO review (ChatGPT), then **scope-reviewed by `plan-eng-review` (Jun 05, 2026)** which code-grounded every claim with a 36-agent adversarial workflow. All process-boundary findings are **pre-existing** (the manual fork-exec path had them too) and confirmed by code reading, **not** introduced by M82 — M82 is behaviour-preserving and explicitly does not touch them (M82 Discovery, "Sandbox-hardening" entry, Indy-acked).

> **Provenance is load-bearing.** Findings come from reading `sandbox_args.zig` / `child_process.zig` / `child_exec.zig` / `child_supervisor.zig` under an adversarial lens, not from a vulnerability report. The exact env/fd/cap surface was re-confirmed at plan-eng-review against the then-current source; re-confirm again at PLAN.

**Canonical architecture:** the host-resident `zombie-runner` execution plane (`docs/architecture/` runner-fleet docs). The sandbox model is bwrap (namespaces) + Landlock (in-child) + cgroup (kill domain); this workstream hardens the **process-boundary env / fd / capability / process-group surface** that sits underneath those, not the namespace/LSM layers.

## Implementing agent — read these first

1. `docs/AUTH.md` — `ZOMBIE_RUNNER_TOKEN` is the daemon's control-plane credential; §1 exists because it can currently leak into the sandbox. Auth-boundary file — `/review` the env-allowlist change specifically.
2. `src/runner/sandbox_args.zig` — `appendBwrap` (the bwrap argv builder) and `bwrapPath`; §1 (clearenv + setenv + cap-drop + new-session) + §3 land here.
3. `src/runner/child_process.zig` — `forkExec` (`std.process.spawn`), `killChild` (the `kill(-pgid)` fallback); §3 (argv[0]) + §4 (kill-tree both-fix) land here.
4. `src/runner/child_supervisor.zig` — `supervise` (the `addProcess` enrollment), `establishSandbox`; §4 (fail-closed enrollment) lands here.
5. `src/runner/child_exec.zig` — the in-child `__execute` entry; the `no-new-privs` prctl (§1, Dim 1.5) lands here next to `landlock.applyPolicy`. Documents the "secrets ride stdin, never argv/env" contract this workstream extends to the daemon's own token.
6. `src/runner/engine/landlock.zig` — context for Dim 1.5: `applyPolicy` calls `landlock_restrict_self` **without** setting `no_new_privs` (succeeds via the userns `CAP_SYS_ADMIN` path), so `no-new-privs` is *not* guaranteed by our code today.
7. `docs/ZIG_RULES.md` — all `*.zig` edits.

## PR Intent & comprehension handshake

- **PR title (eventual):** `build(m84): harden runner sandbox — clearenv, cap-drop, no-new-privs, new-session, CLOEXEC proof, absolute argv[0], kill-domain`
- **Intent (one sentence):** Ensure an untrusted sandboxed agent cannot read the daemon's environment (incl. `ZOMBIE_RUNNER_TOKEN`), holds no Linux capabilities and cannot gain privilege via setuid, cannot inherit a non-`CLOEXEC` daemon file descriptor or a controlling terminal, cannot influence `argv[0]` resolution — and that the containment kill domain can never be silently empty.
- **Handshake (agent fills at PLAN, before EXECUTE):** restate intent; list `ASSUMPTIONS I'M MAKING:`. **Re-confirm the env passthrough allowlist (§1, Dim 1.2) against a *verified enumeration* of every in-child env read** (not the illustrative 5) — a too-tight allowlist breaks tool execution; a too-loose one re-opens the leak.

---

## Applicable Rules

- **`docs/greptile-learnings/RULES.md`**:
  - **RULE UFS** — the env passthrough allowlist (var names), the daemon deny-prefix, and bwrap flag literals (`--clearenv`, `--setenv`, `--cap-drop`, `--new-session`) are single-sourced named constants, referenced from both `appendBwrap` and its tests — never re-spelled.
  - **RULE NLG** — pre-2.0: no "legacy"/"compat" framing for the hardened path; the unhardened behaviour is simply replaced, not shimmed.
  - **RULE NDC / NLR** — no dead code; **§2 is proof-only** (Zig opens are `CLOEXEC` by default and no daemon fd ≥ 3 is open at spawn — see §2), so §2 adds *assertions + regression tests*, never a no-op production "guard".
- **`docs/ZIG_RULES.md`** — all `*.zig` edits (tagged-union results, `errdefer`, cross-compile both linux targets).
- **`docs/AUTH.md`** — `ZOMBIE_RUNNER_TOKEN` handling; the env-allowlist change is auth-boundary and must not alter how the daemon *itself* reads or sends the token, only what the child inherits.
- **`docs/LOGGING_STANDARD.md`** — any new "env_cleared"/"caps_dropped"/"fd_audit" emit follows the logfmt envelope; never log the token or a full environ dump.

## Applicable Gates

| Gate | Fires? | Satisfaction strategy |
|------|--------|-----------------------|
| ZIG GATE | **yes** — `*.zig` edits | Read `docs/ZIG_RULES.md`; cross-compile both linux targets before commit. |
| UFS | **yes** — allowlist + deny-prefix + bwrap flags | Named constants in `sandbox_args.zig`, reused in tests (`// pin test` only where the literal IS the bwrap contract). |
| LENGTH (≤350/≤50/≤70) | **yes** — two hotspots | (1) `appendBwrap` grows (clearenv + setenv loop + cap-drop + new-session): extract an env/cap emit helper so it stays ≤50 lines. (2) **`child_supervisor.zig` is 326/350 today** — Fix A (fail-closed enrollment) adds a branch + error path and is the single most likely 350-line **file-cap** trip: extract an `enrollOrFail` helper (or sibling-file move). Confirmed by Orly CTO review. |
| LOGGING | **maybe** — new audit emit | Envelope unchanged; never log secret values. |
| LIFECYCLE | **no** | No new heap/handle ownership; fd hygiene tightens flags, adds no resource. |
| SCHEMA / ERROR REGISTRY / UI / DESIGN TOKEN | **maybe ERROR REGISTRY** — §4 fail-closed reuses `ERR_RUN_SANDBOX_ESTABLISH_FAILED`; if a distinct enrollment-failure code is added, register it. No schema, no UI. |

## Overview

**Goal (testable):** A token planted in the daemon's environment never appears in the sandboxed child's environment or argv; the child holds **no** Linux capabilities and **`NoNewPrivs:1`**; it has no controlling terminal; **no** non-`CLOEXEC` daemon file descriptor is inherited; `forkExec` rejects a non-absolute `argv[0]` before `spawn`; and a forking agent's whole tree is reaped on revocation/timeout **even if cgroup enrollment failed** — each proven by a negative/regression test.

**Problem:** The host runner spawns an untrusted, prompt-injectable agent inside bwrap + Landlock + cgroup. Process-boundary leaks sit *underneath* that isolation:

1. **Env (§1, live P0).** `forkExec` (`child_process.zig:32`) passes no `.environ_map` to `std.process.spawn`, and `appendBwrap` has no `--clearenv` — so the child inherits the daemon environ, exposing `ZOMBIE_RUNNER_TOKEN` (the control-plane credential). *On sandboxed tiers the cross-process `/proc/<daemon>/environ` read is already shut by `--unshare-all` (pid namespace) + `--proc /proc`; the residual leak is the child's **own** environ (`cat /proc/self/environ`), which `--clearenv` closes.*
2. **Capabilities / privilege (§1, defense-in-depth).** No explicit `--cap-drop ALL`; the child relies entirely on the `--unshare-all` user namespace to neuter caps namespace-locally. No `--new-session` (controlling-terminal / TIOCSTI surface). `no_new_privs` is not set by our code (Landlock succeeds via userns `CAP_SYS_ADMIN`, not NNP), so setuid binaries RO-bound into `/usr`,`/bin`,`/sbin` are a contingent risk.
3. **FD (§2, already mitigated — proof only).** `std.process.spawn` makes pipes `pipe2(CLOEXEC)`, only fd 0/1/2 cross via `dup2`, and the daemon holds no socket/db/cgroup fd open at spawn (per-call `http.Client` deinit; sequential reap-before-next-fork). No live patch — assertions + regression sweep.
4. **argv[0] (§3).** `std.process.spawn` resolves a relative `argv[0]` via the **parent** `PATH`; `buildArgv` already produces absolute paths — make the invariant fail-closed.
5. **Kill domain (§4, live containment bug).** `addProcess` enrollment failure is non-fatal (`child_supervisor.zig:159`); the child then runs in the *daemon's* cgroup (bypassing `memory.max`/`cpu.max`), and `scope.kill()` writes `cgroup.kill=1` to the **empty** exec-cgroup — which **succeeds** — so the `kill(-pid)` fallback (only inside the cgroup-write `catch`) never fires and a forking child's tree survives.

None is introduced by M82 (behaviour-preserving) — all pre-exist.

**Solution summary:** Clear the child's environment at the bwrap boundary (`--clearenv`) and re-inject only a verified allowlist (`--setenv`); drop all capabilities (`--cap-drop ALL`), set `no_new_privs` in-child, and detach the controlling terminal (`--new-session`); assert (don't patch) that every daemon fd is `CLOEXEC`; assert `argv[0]` absolute (fail-closed) before `spawn`; and make the kill domain un-emptyable (fail-closed on enrollment failure **and** always also signal the process group). Behaviour for the legitimate sandboxed lease is unchanged — only the leak/escape surface is removed.

**Prioritization (CTO review + plan-eng-review, Jun 2026).** Ranked for *this* codebase: **(1)** environment sanitisation (§1, the only live credential leak), **(2)** kill-domain un-emptying (§4, live containment bug), **(3)** cap-drop / no-new-privs / new-session (§1, cheap defense-in-depth that lands in the same `appendBwrap`/`child_exec` edit), **(4)** argv[0] guard (§3), **(5)** fd CLOEXEC proof (§2 — the *cheapest* finding, not the strongest: the vector is already closed). §5 verifies the *existing* network/fs containment as M84 acceptance (mechanism owned elsewhere).

## Prior-Art / Reference Implementations

- **bwrap `--clearenv` + `--setenv` + `--cap-drop ALL` + `--new-session`** is the canonical hardened-sandbox pattern (Flatpak, `bubblewrap(1)`); the existing `appendBwrap` flag-emit style (`dup` each arg) is the in-repo pattern to extend.
- **CLOEXEC-by-default** — Zig `std.Io`/`std.fs` file opens set `O_CLOEXEC`; the workstream's job is to *prove* the daemon holds no non-CLOEXEC fd at spawn time, mirroring how `posix_spawn` users audit fd inheritance.
- **`PR_SET_NO_NEW_PRIVS`** — set in-child via `prctl` adjacent to `landlock.applyPolicy`; the kernel mandates it for any later privilege-restricting step and it permanently defangs setuid.

## Files Changed (blast radius)

| File | Action | Why |
|------|--------|-----|
| `src/runner/sandbox_args.zig` | EDIT | `appendBwrap`: emit `--clearenv` + `--setenv <allowlist>` (§1.1/1.2), `--cap-drop ALL` (§1.4), `--new-session` (§1.6); add the allowlist + deny-prefix + flag constants. |
| `src/runner/child_exec.zig` | EDIT | Set `PR_SET_NO_NEW_PRIVS` in the sandboxed fail-closed block, adjacent to `landlock.applyPolicy` (§1.5). |
| `src/runner/child_process.zig` | EDIT | `forkExec`: assert `argv[0]` absolute before `spawn` (§3); `killChild`: **always also** `kill(-pgid)` even on cgroup-kill success (§4). |
| `src/runner/child_supervisor.zig` | EDIT | `supervise`: **fail-closed** when `addProcess` enrollment fails — refuse the lease (kill the just-forked child, return a sandbox-establish failure) instead of warn-and-continue (§4). |
| `src/runner/sandbox_args_edge_test.zig` (+ a runner integration aggregator `*_test.zig`) | EDIT/CREATE | Unit golden-argv tests; **Linux-only integration tests** (planted-token, caps=0, NoNewPrivs=1, no-tty, marker/stray fd, relative argv[0], kill-tree, enrollment-fail kill, network/fs containment) registered on the new runner integration step. |
| `build_runner.zig` | EDIT | Add a `test-integration` step (separate from the `test` unit step), rooted at the runner integration aggregator. |
| `make/test-integration.mk` | EDIT | Add the `test-integration-runner` lane (drives `zig build --build-file build_runner.zig test-integration`); distinct from the app `test-integration` (Docker/Postgres/Redis). |
| `docs/AUTH.md` | EDIT (small) | Note the runner token is `--clearenv`-isolated from the sandboxed child. |

## Decomposition & alternatives (patch vs refactor)

- **Chosen shape:** one atomic workstream (B1); Sections share the spawn path but have separate tests. It is a **patch** (additive hardening, behaviour-preserving for the legitimate path) — no new abstraction.
- **Alternatives considered:** (a) **Pass a filtered `Environ.Map` to `process.spawn` instead of bwrap `--clearenv`** — viable for the `dev_none` (no-bwrap) tier, but for sandboxed tiers `--clearenv` is the defence-in-depth layer that also covers a future direct-exec path; the `dev_none` `environ_map` is **out of scope** (trusted-dev, no-isolation by definition). (b) **Drop env entirely** — rejected: the in-child engine reads `NULLCLAW_OBSERVER` and tools need `PATH`/`HOME`/`TMPDIR`; a verified allowlist is required, not a blanket drop. (c) **Rely on bwrap's default `no_new_privs`** — rejected as contingent (version-dependent); set it explicitly in-child (Dim 1.5).

---

## Sections (implementation slices)

### §1 — Environment isolation + capability/privilege hardening for the sandboxed child

bwrap currently inherits the daemon environment, so a prompt-injected agent can read `ZOMBIE_RUNNER_TOKEN` from its own environ and exfiltrate the daemon's control-plane credential. Clear the environment at the bwrap boundary and pass through only a verified allowlist — **fail closed**: clear first, re-add only what is named. While in the same `appendBwrap`/`child_exec` edit, drop all capabilities, set `no_new_privs`, and detach the controlling terminal — cheap, byte-adjacent defense-in-depth that the spec's own prioritization ranks above the fd proof.

> **Closure model (keep in the spec so a future maintainer does not misread it).** `--clearenv` shuts the child's **own**-environ read. The **cross-process** read (`cat /proc/<daemon>/environ`) is *already* shut on sandboxed tiers by `--unshare-all` (pid namespace) + `--proc /proc` — the daemon is not in the child's pid namespace. Do not remove the namespace thinking `--clearenv` covers the cross-proc case; it does not.

- **Dimension 1.1** — `appendBwrap` emits `--clearenv` ahead of the command on sandboxed tiers → Test `test_bwrap_argv_clears_env`
- **Dimension 1.2** — only the **verified allowlist** is re-injected via `--setenv`; the daemon deny-prefix (`ZOMBIE_*`) never appears in argv regardless of allowlist contents → Test `test_bwrap_argv_omits_daemon_secrets`. **The allowlist is derived at PLAN from a verified enumeration of every in-child env read**, not the illustrative list. *Known reads (plan-eng-review, Jun 05):* `NULLCLAW_OBSERVER` (`runner_observer.zig:26`, **optional** — safe default `.log_backend`); `PATH`/`HOME`/`TMPDIR` (load-bearing for tool subprocesses + NullClaw `getHomeDir`/`getTempDir`); NullClaw `config.zig applyEnvOverrides` reads `NULLCLAW_PROVIDER/MODEL/TEMPERATURE/GATEWAY_*/WORKSPACE/ALLOW_PUBLIC_BIND` — but the runner injects provider/model via the **lease `agent_config`** (`child_exec.zig:155-174`), not env, so these are **probably not load-bearing**. PLAN must confirm whether any `NULLCLAW_*` is daemon-static-via-env and relied upon; if so, allowlist it. No in-child code reads `ZOMBIE_*` (deny-prefix is safe).
- **Dimension 1.3** — a token planted in the daemon environment does not reach the child's environment, proven via **both** the child's `/proc/self/environ` **and** a `getenv(ZOMBIE_RUNNER_TOKEN)` call inside `__execute` (the agent's real read path) → Test `test_planted_token_absent_from_child_env`
- **Dimension 1.4 (NEW)** — `appendBwrap` emits `--cap-drop ALL`, so the child holds no capabilities even inside its own user namespace → Test `test_bwrap_argv_cap_drop_all` (golden argv) + `test_child_has_no_caps` (child reads `/proc/self/status` → `CapEff: 0000000000000000`). **Coupled to Dim 1.5:** dropping caps removes the userns `CAP_SYS_ADMIN` that `landlock_restrict_self` relies on today, so **1.5 (NNP) must land first** or Landlock fails closed. `--cap-drop` is bwrap-version-gated (~0.4.0+); a build whose bwrap lacks it errors out → lease fails closed (Failure Modes). PLAN must `bwrap --cap-drop` live-probe on the Linux lane.
- **Dimension 1.5 (NEW)** — `child_exec` sets `PR_SET_NO_NEW_PRIVS` (prctl 38) in the sandboxed fail-closed block **before** `landlock.applyPolicy`, making the guarantee structural rather than bwrap-version-dependent AND restoring `landlock_restrict_self`'s precondition once Dim 1.4 drops `CAP_SYS_ADMIN`; setuid binaries in the RO mounts are permanently defanged → Test `test_child_no_new_privs` (child reads `/proc/self/status` → `NoNewPrivs: 1`). *NNP also disables any in-sandbox tool that needs a setuid helper (`ping`/`sudo`) — acceptable by design (agents get no escalation); PLAN enumerates whether any engine-invoked tool relies on one.*
- **Dimension 1.6 (NEW)** — `appendBwrap` emits `--new-session`, detaching the controlling terminal (closes the TIOCSTI terminal-input-injection vector if a tty is ever attached) → Test `test_bwrap_argv_new_session` (golden argv) + `test_child_no_controlling_tty` (child run from a pty-allocated parent cannot `ioctl(TIOCSTI)` into the parent's terminal)
- **Dimension 1.7 (tier-gating, F6)** — all §1 flags apply to **every** sandboxed tier including `registry_allowlist`; a `--clearenv` that skipped `registry_allowlist` would re-open the token path with a live host-net exfil route (see §5.1). → asserted in the golden-argv tests under both `deny_all` and `registry_allowlist`

### §2 — File-descriptor hygiene (proof only — RULE NDC)

`process.spawn` wires the configured stdio but does **not** close arbitrary parent fds; any non-`CLOEXEC` descriptor the daemon holds would be inherited. The classic sandbox escape is **inheriting an already-open capability across `exec`** — a unix socket, a db connection, a control pipe, a cgroup fd, an eventfd.

**Verified at plan-eng-review (Jun 05): the daemon holds no such fd.** `std.process.spawn` makes pipes `pipe2(CLOEXEC)`; only fd 0/1/2 cross via `dup2`; the control-plane `http.Client` is created/`deinit`'d per call; cgroup control fds are `defer`-closed within their function; the supervisor reaps before the next fork. So **§2 is invariant proof + regression sweep, NOT a production patch** — adding a runtime "guard" would be a RULE NDC no-op.

- **Dimension 2.1** — Discovery enumerates every daemon open site (cgroup control files, control-plane `http.Client`, lease pipes, log sinks) and records each as already-`CLOEXEC` (Zig default) — an **assertion table**, not a code change → recorded in Discovery
- **Dimension 2.2** — a marker capability fd opened by the daemon is **not** accessible in the spawned child (`fcntl(N, F_GETFD)` → `EBADF`) → Test `test_marker_fd_not_inherited_by_child`
- **Dimension 2.3** — the spawned child sees no unexpected open fd ≥ 3 beyond its wired stdio → Test `test_no_stray_fds_in_child`
- **Dimension 2.4** — `forkExec` leaves `process.spawn`'s `progress_node = .none`, so std's `prog_fileno = 3` path never `dup2`s a fourth fd across `exec`; the Dim 2.3 sweep asserts fd 3 absent and `forkExec` asserts `progress_node == .none`. If live progress streaming is ever wired into the runner spawn, fd-inheritance is re-reviewed here. → Test `test_no_stray_fds_in_child` (fd-3 case) + the call-site assertion
- **Dimension 2.5** — regression: an assertion that the control-plane `http.Client`'s transient socket carries `FD_CLOEXEC`, so a future keep-alive/pooled client cannot silently re-open the inheritance vector → Test `test_control_plane_socket_is_cloexec`

> **Honest framing for the PR:** §2 is the cheapest finding here, not the strongest. The strongest *live* fix is §1 (the credential leak); the strongest *latent* fix is §4 (the kill-domain bug).

### §3 — `argv[0]` absolute guard

`std.process.spawn` resolves a relative `argv[0]` against the **parent** `PATH`; an absolute `argv[0]` is the invariant that closes any PATH-influence vector (a future refactor changing `"/usr/bin/bwrap"` to `"bwrap"` must not silently create a `PATH` trust dependency). `buildArgv` already produces absolute paths (bwrap path / `executablePathAlloc`); make the invariant explicit and fail-closed.

- **Dimension 3.1** — `forkExec` rejects a non-absolute `argv[0]` before `spawn` (fail-closed, reusing the sandbox-setup failure class) → Test `test_relative_argv0_rejected`

### §4 — Containment kill-tree: un-emptyable kill domain (both fixes)

The cgroup is the primary, atomic kill domain; `kill(-pgid, SIGKILL)` is the fallback when cgroup v2 is unavailable or `cgroup.kill` fails, and is the *only* kill on `dev_none`/macOS. The live bug: `addProcess` enrollment failure is non-fatal (`child_supervisor.zig:159`), so the child runs in the *daemon's* cgroup (bypassing `memory.max`/`cpu.max`); `scope.kill()` then writes `cgroup.kill=1` to the **empty** exec-cgroup, which **succeeds**, so the `kill(-pid)` fallback (only inside the cgroup-write `catch`) never fires and a forking child's tree survives.

**Decision (Indy, Jun 05): implement BOTH fixes.**

```
addProcess(child) FAILS → FAIL CLOSED: kill the just-forked child + refuse the
   lease (return sandbox-establish failure). Closes the bug AND the memory.max /
   cpu.max bypass; matches Invariant 7's fail-closed posture.            (Fix A)

killChild() → ALWAYS also kill(-pgid, SIGKILL), regardless of cgroup.kill success
   (remove the early `return` after a successful cgroup.kill). Belt-and-suspenders
   for the enroll-succeeds-then-cgroup.kill-races path.                  (Fix B)
```

> **Reconciliation with §1.6 `--new-session`.** `killChild`'s `kill(-pid)` targets **bwrap's** pid — the process-group leader (`.pgid = 0` → `setpgid(0,0)`). `--new-session` makes the bwrap child a *session* leader too, which reinforces (does not break) the group-kill: bwrap stays the group leader the daemon signals, and the agent's own `setsid()` cannot move bwrap out of that group.
> **Fix B pid-reuse safety.** The unconditional pgroup signal is safe **because `killChild` runs before `reaped = true; child.wait()`** — the killed child stays an un-reaped zombie (pid/pgid not reusable) until the single `wait()`. A future refactor must not move `wait()` earlier, or it reintroduces a pgid-reuse window. A post-`cgroup.kill` `kill(-pid)` may return `ESRCH` (group already dead) — harmless, already logged.

- **Dimension 4.1** — `kill(-child_pid, SIGKILL)` reaps a child that forked a grandchild and great-grandchild, **including an adversarial child that calls `setsid()`/`setpgid()` before forking**, with no escapee left running → Test `test_pgroup_kill_reaps_descendant_tree`
- **Dimension 4.2** — cgroup enrollment failure cannot silently disable the kill domain: inject an `addProcess` failure → the lease is **refused fail-closed** (Fix A) and, on the success-then-race path, `killChild` **always** also signals the process group (Fix B). The kill domain is never silently empty. → Test `test_kill_survives_cgroup_enrollment_failure`

### §5 — Sandbox containment verification (defense-in-depth — covers ChatGPT #2 network, #4 filesystem)

> **Ownership boundary (kept in M84 per Indy, Jun 05; framing tightened).** The **mechanisms** (network namespace, bwrap mounts, Landlock) are owned by the M80 runner-fleet specs and the network-policy roadmap. M84 owns **only the acceptance proof** that containment holds — characterization/regression tests that **pass at M84 start** and must stay green. They do **not** change any mechanism. If one of these tests ever fails, it is a regression in the *owning* spec's mechanism; M84's role is to pin it.

- **Dimension 5.1** — network egress (ChatGPT #2). On a sandboxed tier under the default `deny_all` policy, the child cannot reach the network: a `connect()` to an external host fails at the kernel — `--unshare-all` (`sandbox_args.zig:79`) gives an empty network namespace. → Test `test_sandboxed_child_network_denied`
  - **Known gap, pinned not closed here:** under the `registry_allowlist` opt-in, `--share-net` re-joins the host netns and the allowlist is **log-only** (`runner_network_policy.zig:5-9`) — no kernel egress restriction today, so the child has **full host-network egress** incl. loopback (the control-plane port) and link-local metadata (`169.254.169.254`). With `--clearenv` the token itself is gone, but per-lease tenant secrets (the resolved provider `api_key`, tool secrets) remain exfiltratable over that open net — so **`--clearenv` is the only barrier under `registry_allowlist`** until nftables lands. A characterization test pins the current behaviour so the network-policy roadmap closes it knowingly and the assertion flips when it lands. → Test `test_registry_allowlist_egress_unrestricted_today`
- **Dimension 5.2** — filesystem exposure (ChatGPT #4). The sandboxed child cannot read host `/home` / `/var` / `/root` (never bound) and cannot write `/etc` (RO bind); only the lease workspace and the `/tmp` tmpfs are writable. (Landlock is genuinely wired — `landlock.zig:124`, real `landlock_restrict_self`.) → Test `test_sandboxed_child_fs_isolation`

if (std.os.linux.prctl(@intFromEnum(std.os.linux.PR.SET_NO_NEW_PRIVS), 1, 0, 0, 0) != 0)
    return SANDBOX_FAIL_EXIT;
// ORDER IS LOAD-BEARING: NNP must be set BEFORE landlock_restrict_self. Once Dim 1.4
// (--cap-drop ALL) removes the userns CAP_SYS_ADMIN that restrict_self relies on today,
// no_new_privs becomes its ONLY remaining precondition — 1.4 and 1.5 must land together.

# src/runner/child_process.zig — fail-closed guard before spawn
if (!std.fs.path.isAbsolute(argv[0])) return error.SandboxArgvNotAbsolute;

# src/runner/child_process.zig — killChild ALWAYS also signals the group (Fix B)
// cgroup.kill is primary; the pgroup signal is unconditional belt-and-suspenders.

# src/runner/child_supervisor.zig — fail-closed enrollment (Fix A)
// addProcess failure → kill child + return failed(.startup_posture); never warn-and-continue.
```

Contract: the legitimate execution path (allowlisted env present, absolute `argv[0]`, successful cgroup enrollment) is byte-for-byte unchanged in observable behaviour; only the leak/escape surface is removed.

## Failure Modes

| Mode | Cause | Handling (system response + what the caller observes) |
|------|-------|--------------------------------------------------------|
| Allowlist too tight | a var the engine/tools need is omitted | tool execution fails inside the sandbox; caught by the integration smoke test that runs a `PATH`-needing tool under `--clearenv`; allowlist widened deliberately at PLAN |
| Allowlist too loose | a secret-bearing var slips into the allowlist | `test_bwrap_argv_omits_daemon_secrets` asserts the `ZOMBIE_*` deny-prefix is absent regardless of allowlist contents |
| `--clearenv`/cap-drop on a non-bwrap tier | applied where there is no bwrap (`dev_none`) | §1 is gated on `sandboxed`; `dev_none` path unchanged (out of scope, trusted-dev) |
| `no_new_privs` prctl fails | kernel rejects the prctl | `child_exec` returns `SANDBOX_FAIL_EXIT` (fail-closed, Invariant 7) — the lease is classified a sandbox failure, never run |
| `--cap-drop` unsupported | bwrap older than ~0.4.0 on the runner image | bwrap errors out on the unknown flag → `forkExec` spawn fails → lease fails closed. PLAN live-probes `bwrap --cap-drop` on the Linux lane |
| Tool needs a setuid helper | `ping`/`sudo`/`mount` post-`no_new_privs` | the helper fails inside the sandbox — **acceptable by design** (untrusted agents get no privilege escalation); PLAN enumerates whether any engine-invoked tool relies on one |
| Stray capability fd inherited | a daemon open site forgets `CLOEXEC` | `test_marker_fd_not_inherited_by_child` + `test_no_stray_fds_in_child` fail the build before merge |
| Relative `argv[0]` reaches spawn | a future `buildArgv` change emits a relative path | `test_relative_argv0_rejected` + the runtime guard fail-close the lease |
| cgroup enrollment fails | transient `/sys/fs/cgroup` write error | **Fix A** refuses the lease fail-closed (kills the child); the kill domain is never silently empty, and the child never runs unmetered |
| Group-kill misses a descendant | child re-parents / breaks its own pgroup | `test_pgroup_kill_reaps_descendant_tree` (incl. adversarial `setsid`) fails; cgroup tree-kill remains the primary domain regardless |

---

## Invariants

1. **No daemon secret in the child environment** — `ZOMBIE_*` (incl. `ZOMBIE_RUNNER_TOKEN`) never appears in the child's environ or argv, on every sandboxed tier incl. `registry_allowlist`. Enforced by `test_bwrap_argv_omits_daemon_secrets` + `test_planted_token_absent_from_child_env`.
2. **Child holds no capabilities and cannot gain privilege** — `CapEff: 0` (Dim 1.4) and `NoNewPrivs: 1` (Dim 1.5) inside `__execute`. Setuid binaries in the RO mounts are inert.
3. **No controlling terminal** — `--new-session` detaches it (Dim 1.6); TIOCSTI injection is closed.
4. **Every daemon fd is `CLOEXEC`** — *all*, not most; no unexpected fd ≥ 3 reaches the child. Enforced by the assertion table (Dim 2.1) + `test_marker_fd_not_inherited_by_child` + `test_no_stray_fds_in_child` + `test_control_plane_socket_is_cloexec`. Spawn's `progress_node` stays `.none` (Dim 2.4). **Proof, not patch.**
5. **`argv[0]` is always absolute** — runtime guard + `test_relative_argv0_rejected`.
6. **Kill domain is never silently empty** — enrollment failure refuses the lease fail-closed (Fix A); `killChild` always also signals the process group (Fix B). Enforced by `test_kill_survives_cgroup_enrollment_failure` + `test_pgroup_kill_reaps_descendant_tree`.
7. **Legitimate path unchanged** — the allowlisted env + absolute argv[0] + enrolled case produces an identical observable outcome; a golden-argv test pins the argv shape (now incl. the new flags).
8. **Single-owner reap (spawn-migration handle-ownership contract)** — the supervisor is the **sole** reaper: exactly one `wait()`, guarded by `reaped`. The `process.Child` wrapper from `std.process.spawn` is **non-authoritative** — `child.wait()` is never called outside the supervisor's reap path, and `child.kill()` is never called (containment is cgroup-atomic via `killChild`). Enforced as a code comment at the reap site in `child_supervisor.zig`. No new test — the spawn-mechanics tests live in **M82_001 Batch 6** (M82 is DONE).

## Test Specification (tiered)

> **Lane (plan-eng-review F8 / Indy CTO decision):** the Linux-only integration tests run on a **dedicated runner integration lane** — `make test-integration-runner` → `zig build --build-file build_runner.zig test-integration` — **not** the app `test-integration` (Docker/Postgres/Redis) and **not** the fast `test-unit-zigrunner` lane. Rationale: these tests fork real bwrap children, mount `/proc`, fault-inject cgroup enrollment, and `kill(-pid)` a fork tree — a distinct privileged-Linux execution environment (bwrap + cgroup v2 + user-ns), which is a genuine distinct caller need. They are `builtin.os.tag == .linux`-gated (`SkipZigTest` on macOS). **macOS dev-loop proof = cross-compile the runner TEST graph**: `zig build --build-file build_runner.zig test-integration -Dtarget=x86_64-linux && -Dtarget=aarch64-linux` (compile-check the Linux-only bodies; real execution is the CI Linux lane).

| Dimension | Tier | Test | Asserts (concrete inputs → expected output) |
|-----------|------|------|---------------------------------------------|
| 1.1 | unit | `test_bwrap_argv_clears_env` | sandboxed `buildArgv` output contains `--clearenv` before `--` |
| 1.2 | unit | `test_bwrap_argv_omits_daemon_secrets` | argv contains no `ZOMBIE_*` var; contains `--setenv` for each allowlisted var present |
| 1.3 | integration-runner | `test_planted_token_absent_from_child_env` | daemon env has `ZOMBIE_RUNNER_TOKEN=probe`; child's `/proc/self/environ` AND in-child `getenv` lack `probe` |
| 1.4 | unit + integration-runner | `test_bwrap_argv_cap_drop_all` / `test_child_has_no_caps` | argv contains `--cap-drop ALL`; child `/proc/self/status` → `CapEff: 0000000000000000` |
| 1.5 | integration-runner | `test_child_no_new_privs` | child `/proc/self/status` → `NoNewPrivs: 1` |
| 1.6 | unit + integration-runner | `test_bwrap_argv_new_session` / `test_child_no_controlling_tty` | argv contains `--new-session`; child from a pty parent cannot `TIOCSTI`-inject |
| 1.7 | unit | `test_bwrap_argv_flags_under_registry_allowlist` | `--clearenv`/`--cap-drop ALL`/`--new-session` ALL present under BOTH `deny_all` AND `registry_allowlist` (the load-bearing assertion given §5.1's open-net gap) |
| 2.1 | (assertion) | Discovery table | each audited daemon open returns an fd with `FD_CLOEXEC` set (no code change) |
| 2.2 | integration-runner | `test_marker_fd_not_inherited_by_child` | daemon opens marker fd N; child `fcntl(N, F_GETFD)` → `EBADF` |
| 2.3 | integration-runner | `test_no_stray_fds_in_child` | child enumerates `/proc/self/fd`; only wired stdio (0/1/2) present |
| 2.4 | unit + integration-runner | `test_forkexec_progress_node_none` (+ fd-3 case in `test_no_stray_fds_in_child`) | `forkExec` asserts `progress_node == .none` (PLAN: verify the field name on 0.16 `SpawnOptions`); child `/proc/self/fd` has no fd 3 |
| 2.5 | unit | `test_control_plane_socket_is_cloexec` | control-plane client's socket has `FD_CLOEXEC` set |
| 3.1 | unit | `test_relative_argv0_rejected` | `forkExec` with a relative `argv[0]` → `error.SandboxArgvNotAbsolute`, no spawn |
| 4.1 | integration-runner | `test_pgroup_kill_reaps_descendant_tree` | child (incl. one that `setsid`s) forks grandchild+great-grandchild; `kill(-pid)` → all reaped |
| 4.2 | integration-runner | `test_kill_survives_cgroup_enrollment_failure` | inject `addProcess` failure → lease refused fail-closed (Fix A); success-then-race → pgroup also signalled (Fix B) |
| 5.1 | integration-runner | `test_sandboxed_child_network_denied` | sandboxed child under `deny_all` → `connect()` to external host fails at the kernel (empty netns) |
| 5.1-gap | integration-runner | `test_registry_allowlist_egress_unrestricted_today` | `registry_allowlist` tier → child reaches an external host (pins the current no-kernel-egress gap; flips when nftables lands) |
| 5.2 | integration-runner | `test_sandboxed_child_fs_isolation` | child: write `/etc/<x>` → denied (RO); `/home`/`/var`/`/root` absent; write lease workspace → ok |

- **Regression:** the existing runner suite (`make test-unit-zigrunner`) + the app `make test` must pass unchanged — the legitimate sandboxed lease still runs end-to-end.
- **Idempotency/replay:** N/A.

## Discovery (consult log)

- **Origin (Jun 03, 2026):** surfaced in the M82_001 `forkExec → process.spawn` CTO/threat-model walkthrough. Process-boundary findings (env inheritance → token exfil; non-CLOEXEC fd inheritance; relative-`argv[0]` PATH resolution). M82 is behaviour-preserving and does not change them.
  - **Indy go (verbatim, Jun 03, 2026):** _"ensure the sandbox-hardening followup is done (separate spec)"_ — context: file the findings as their own security spec, not folded into the toolchain bump.
- **CTO review — ChatGPT (Jun 03, 2026):** concurred with the architecture (spawn for creation, cgroup as authoritative kill boundary, raw-fd supervisor preserved) and ranked the hardening above the migration. Folded in: env allowlist + fail-closed deny-prefix; FD hygiene as the named "strongest" finding; the kill-tree regression; `--cap-drop ALL` and `--new-session` as cheap defense-in-depth; env-inheritance and FD-inheritance as the top attack classes.
- **CTO adversarial review — Orly (Jun 03, 2026, code-grounded multi-agent):** post-refutation verdicts ranked env (§1, P0) > fd (§2, mitigated/proof) > argv (§3, guard) > kill-tree (§4, caveat). CSPRNG cross-spec note belongs to M82 (DONE).
- **plan-eng-review (Jun 05, 2026, 36-agent code-grounded workflow + adversarial refutation):** every `file:line` claim re-verified against `main`; candidate escapes adversarially refuted. Outcomes:
  - **Refuted (do not re-litigate):** `/proc/1/environ` token read after clearenv (REFUTED — `--unshare-all` pid-ns + `--proc` makes the daemon invisible and bwrap is not pid 1 in the child ns); ptrace cross-read (closed by pid-ns); pooled `http.Client` socket leak (per-call `deinit`); workspace inter-lease residue (per-lease lifecycle in `daemon/loop.zig`); in-memory lease-secret residue (different boundary). 
  - **Confirmed live:** §1 env leak (`child_process.zig:32` no `environ_map`; no `--clearenv`); §4 empty-cgroup kill bug (worse than written — fork-failed `addProcess` also bypasses `memory.max`/`cpu.max`).
  - **Re-shaped:** §2 → proof-only (no production patch — RULE NDC); §1 allowlist → derived from verified enumeration (the in-child engine's only optional read is `NULLCLAW_OBSERVER`; `PATH`/`HOME`/`TMPDIR` carry the load; NullClaw `config.zig:940-980` reads `NULLCLAW_*` but the runner injects provider/model via the lease, not env — PLAN to confirm).
  - **Promoted to Dimensions (F2):** `--cap-drop ALL` (1.4), explicit `PR_SET_NO_NEW_PRIVS` (1.5 — Landlock does NOT set NNP for us; `landlock.zig` succeeds via userns `CAP_SYS_ADMIN`), `--new-session` (1.6).
  - **Indy decisions (verbatim, Jun 05, 2026):**
    - §4 kill-domain fix — _"Both (fail-closed + always-pgroup)"_ → Fix A + Fix B (Dim 4.2).
    - cap-drop / no-new-privs / new-session — _"Promote all three to Dimensions"_ → Dims 1.4/1.5/1.6.
    - §5 containment verification — _"Keep §5 in M84"_ → retained, framing tightened to characterization-only (mechanism owned by M80).
    - test lane — _"Orly CTO decide and tell me so i can approve. I am looking at a clean separation? leaning towards 2. so the existing test-integration for the runner runs as is."_ → **CTO decision: dedicated `test-integration-runner` lane** (option 2). Justified against the no-new-make-target rule by a distinct privileged-Linux execution environment (bwrap + cgroup v2 + user-ns) that neither the unit lane nor the app integration lane provides. **Pending Indy approval to land this spec.**
  - **Renumber (F7):** `M84_001` → `M84_003` (collision with the shipped enrollment spec + the pending fleet-operator-plane spec).
- **Orly CTO adversarial review of the rewritten spec (Jun 05, 2026, code-grounded):** verdict **YELLOW → fixed to GREEN-ready**. Threat model correct, every `file:line` claim held, lane decision justified, kill-domain both-fix proven reap-safe, §1.2 clearenv premise confirmed. Fixes folded in:
  - **P0 — `prctl` interface line would not compile.** Zig 0.16 `prctl(option: i32, ...)` rejects the `PR` enum literal → corrected to `@intFromEnum(std.os.linux.PR.SET_NO_NEW_PRIVS)`; Interfaces block marked illustrative.
  - **P1 — `--cap-drop ALL` ↔ `no_new_privs` coupling** made explicit (NNP before `landlock_restrict_self`; 1.4 can't land without 1.5). `bwrap --cap-drop` version-probe + setuid-tool breakage added to Failure Modes/PLAN.
  - **P1 — LENGTH:** `child_supervisor.zig` (326/350) flagged as the likely file-cap trip under Fix A → `enrollOrFail` helper extraction banked.
  - **P2 — `--new-session` ↔ kill-domain** reconciled (bwrap stays the pgroup leader); Fix B pid-reuse safety pinned to the `wait()`-after-`kill()` ordering.
  - **P2/P3 — test hygiene:** Dim 1.7 got an explicit named test + Acceptance line; Dim 2.4 split into its own `test_forkexec_progress_node_none`; `SpawnOptions.progress_node` field-name flagged PLAN-verify.
- **Remaining security gaps (for the implementing agent, beyond the Sections):**
  1. **`macos_seatbelt` is an unimplemented placeholder** — `establishSandbox` fail-closes any non-Linux host for a non-`dev_none` tier (`child_supervisor.zig:201`). **DEFERRED — Indy (Jun 03, 2026): _"I deferred this, since seatbelt is deprecated long back"_.** macOS isolation story: `dev_none` for trusted local use; untrusted agents on a Mac run inside a Linux VM/guest where the real tiers apply. Keep a test pinning *"macOS + non-`dev_none` → lease refused"* so a self-reported tier can never imply isolation that does not exist.
  2. **Network nftables egress** + the orphaned roadmap spec — see §5.1 / Out of Scope (**no spec ID filed yet — needs filing**).
  3. **Inherited stderr (fd 2)** — the child's fd 2 is the daemon's real stderr (`.stderr = .inherit`); in-child engine logs interleave into the operator stream. Low severity (log noise / weak per-lease attribution), not a secret capability. Out of strict scope; note only.
  4. **Unbounded activity-frame flood on fd 1** — the child controls the frame protocol on its own stdout; `readResult` caps total result bytes (`MAX_RESULT_BYTES`) but not activity-frame count/rate. Frame-protocol hardening, out of strict M84 scope; note for a follow-up.
- **PLAN decisions to bank** — the final env passthrough allowlist (verified enumeration); confirm §2 stays proof-only after the PLAN fd-audit; confirm no `NULLCLAW_*` is daemon-static-via-env and relied upon. **`RUNNER_NETWORK_POLICY` is a PARENT-only read (`config.zig:70`) and must NOT be in the child allowlist.** Verify the Zig 0.16 `prctl` enum coercion (`@intFromEnum`), the `SpawnOptions.progress_node` field name, and `bwrap --cap-drop` support before authoring those lines.
- **Consults** — {Architecture / Legacy-Design / gate-flag triage: question + Indy's decision, as they arise.}
- **Skill chain outcomes** — {`/write-unit-test`, `/review`, `/review-pr` results.}
- **Deferrals** — every "deferred to follow-up" needs an Indy-acked verbatim quote here (seatbelt above is acked; the stderr + frame-flood items are *noted, not deferred-from-scope* — they were never in scope).

## Out of Scope

- **`dev_none` tier env filtering** — that tier runs with no isolation by design (trusted dev); §1 applies only to sandboxed tiers. The release-mode guard (`main.zig`) already refuses `dev_none` as the prod default.
- **Namespace / Landlock / cgroup-membership model changes** — this workstream hardens only the process-boundary env/fd/capability/process-group surface; the bwrap namespace set, the in-child Landlock policy, and the cgroup kill domain are unchanged (owned by the M80 runner-fleet specs). **§5 adds end-to-end containment *verification* (network + fs) as M84 acceptance — proof only, no mechanism change.**
- **Network egress allowlist (nftables)** — tracked separately in the runner network-policy roadmap (**no spec ID filed yet — needs filing**); `--share-net` semantics are untouched here. §5.1 *verifies* the `deny_all` default and *characterizes* the `registry_allowlist` gap; it does not implement nftables.
- **Inherited stderr re-plumbing + activity-frame rate caps** — noted in Discovery; frame-protocol / log-plumbing hardening, separate from env/fd inheritance.
- **Rotating / scoping the runner token** so a leak is lower-impact — a control-plane credential-model change, not a runner-side patch.
