# M66_001: BYOK term retirement, nanos unit, traction rates, single support email

**Prototype:** v2.0.0
**Milestone:** M66
**Workstream:** 001
**Date:** May 10, 2026
**Status:** PENDING
**Priority:** P1 — user-facing pricing change + breaking API rename + single canonical contact email; gates the marketing/economics shape for stealth-mode design partners.
**Categories:** API, CLI, DOCS, UI
**Batch:** B1 — single workstream, sequential sections.
**Branch:** feat/m66-001-byok-retirement (created at CHORE(open))
**Depends on:** none (M65 marketing rephrase work landed via PRs #310 and #311; this spec supersedes the M65 vocabulary split).

**Canonical architecture:** `docs/architecture/billing_and_byok.md` (renamed to `billing_and_provider_keys.md` by §5 of this spec) §0 vocabulary preamble, §1 two postures, §2 pure-credits.

---

## Implementing agent — read these first

1. **`src/state/tenant_billing.zig`** — current canonical rate constants (`STARTER_CREDIT_CENTS`, `EVENT_PLATFORM_CENTS`, `EVENT_BYOK_CENTS`, `STAGE_CENTS`). **Mirror this:** the constant naming + paired pin-test pattern. **Replace this:** the `_CENTS` suffix becomes `_NANOS` and the BYOK constant collapses into a single `EVENT_NANOS = 0`.
2. **`ui/packages/website/src/lib/rates.ts`** — TS mirror of the Zig constants with `RATES_CENTS` / `RATES_DISPLAY` shape. **Mirror this:** the named-constant + paired `rates.test.ts` discipline. **Replace this:** drop `eventPlatform` / `eventByok` distinction; collapse to `event` since both modes price events at zero post-M66.
3. **`~/Projects/docs/snippets/rates.mdx`** — Mintlify-side rate snippet. **Replace these values:** `STARTER_CREDIT = "$5"` (unchanged), `EVENT_RATE = "free"` (was `$0.01`), `STAGE_PLATFORM = "$0.001"`, `STAGE_SELF_MANAGED = "$0.0001"` (new key — two stage rates because the gradient between modes is the whole point). Role names must match Zig/TS exactly — see **Naming convention (cross-tier)** below.
4. **`docs/architecture/billing_and_byok.md` §0 + §1**" — current two-posture model. **Mirror this:** the architecture-doc convention of explicit posture matrix + §0 vocabulary preamble. **Replace these:** every "BYOK" surface in §1, plus the file rename to `billing_and_provider_keys.md`. Internal historical-note preserves the BYOK lineage.
5. **`docs/v2/done/M48_001_P1_API_CLI_UI_BYOK_PROVIDER.md`** — original spec that introduced the BYOK posture. **Read this:** to understand the data model, vault path, and `crypto_store.load()` flow that this spec deliberately preserves.
6. **`docs/v2/done/M51_001_P1_DOCS_SITE_REWRITE_AND_ARCH_CROSSREF.md`** + the `M51 follow-up` changelog entry — establishes the pre-v2.0 pattern for breaking-API removal (HTTP 404, no graceful 410). This spec follows the same posture for the schema-enum rename and CLI-flag rename.
7. **`docs/REST_API_DESIGN_GUIDELINES.md`** §1 (URL design), §4 (error shapes), §10 (pre-PR gates) — the API value rename `mode: "byok"` → `mode: "self_managed"` lands a clean 4xx for the old value with a `replacement` hint per the error-registry pattern.

---

## Applicable Rules

- **`docs/greptile-learnings/RULES.md`** — universal repo discipline. Cross-cutting: RULE UFS (string literals → named constants, applies to the new `SUPPORT_EMAIL` constants), RULE CTM (cross-tier mirroring, applies to rate constants pinned across Zig + TS + docs snippet), RULE TST-NAM (no milestone IDs in test names or code bodies).
- **`docs/ZIG_RULES.md`** — applies to every `.zig` edit in §1, §2, §6: pg-drain lifecycle (line 14-19), Tagged Unions for Result Types, Multi-Step Init errdefer Chain Pattern, Cross-Compile Verification.
- **`docs/REST_API_DESIGN_GUIDELINES.md`** — applies when the diff touches `src/http/handlers/tenant_provider.zig` or `public/openapi/**`. §1 URL design, §4 error shapes (clean 4xx with replacement hint), §7 5-place route registration, §8 `Hx` handler interface, §10 pre-PR gates.
- **`docs/SCHEMA_CONVENTIONS.md`** — applies to the in-place schema edits in §1 and §3 (pre-v2.0 clean-break: edit existing schema files, no `ALTER`, dev DB reseeded via `make down && make up`).
- **`docs/architecture/billing_and_byok.md`** (renamed to `billing_and_provider_keys.md` by this spec) — §0 vocabulary preamble + §1 two postures. After rename, this doc IS canonical for the runtime two-posture model; the spec keeps it consistent with code in the same diff.
- **`docs/LOGGING_STANDARD.md`** §3 wire format, §4 severity, §5 error-code embedding — log scope renames `byok_credential_*` → `self_managed_credential_*` must preserve scope-tag conventions.
- **`docs/AUTH.md`** — credential vault paths are deliberately unchanged; this spec does NOT touch `crypto_store.load()` semantics.
- **`docs/BUN_RULES.md`** — applies to `ui/packages/{website,app}/**.{ts,tsx}` edits in §3, §4: TS FILE SHAPE DECISION at PLAN, const/import/Bun-primitive discipline.
- **RULE NLG** (no legacy framing pre-v2.0) — explicitly invoked. This spec REMOVES the BYOK identifier; it does not add legacy scaffolding. No `--byok` alias on CLI; no `mode: "byok"` accept on API; no `Mode.byok` deprecated variant left in source.

## Overview

### Goal (testable)

After this spec lands: (a) `grep -rn '\bBYOK\b' src/ ui/ zombiectl/ public/ docs/architecture/` returns zero hits in active source/copy (with named exemptions for the architecture-doc historical note and the `~/Projects/docs/changelog.mdx` archive); (b) `mode: "byok"` to `PUT /v1/tenants/me/provider` returns HTTP 400 with error code `UZ-PROVIDER-MODE-RENAMED` naming `self_managed` as the replacement; (c) `cat src/state/tenant_billing.zig | grep -E "STAGE_NANOS|EVENT_NANOS|STARTER_CREDIT_NANOS"` shows `STAGE_PLATFORM_NANOS = 1_000_000`, `STAGE_SELF_MANAGED_NANOS = 100_000`, `EVENT_NANOS = 0`, `STARTER_CREDIT_NANOS = 5_000_000_000`; (d) every literal `hello@usezombie.com` is gone from the repo, replaced by an import of a per-repo `SUPPORT_EMAIL` constant resolving to `usezombie@agentmail.to`.

### Problem

"BYOK" is now the wrong term at every surface. M65 split the vocabulary (user-facing prose says "bring your own model"; internal identifiers stay BYOK), and the split is unstable — every code review now has to enforce the layer boundary, and drift will leak the internal term into user copy. Beyond the term, the M66_001 traction rates ($0/event both modes, $0.001/stage platform, $0.0001/stage self-managed) need a sub-cent-capable billing unit: cents (`i64`) cannot hold $0.0001, and even micros (1/1M USD) bottom out at $0.000001. The canonical billing unit must move to **nanos (1/1,000,000,000 USD = 9 decimal places of precision)**, giving headroom for $0.000001 today and any further sub-cent rate down to $0.000000001 without another unit change. `i64` BIGINT holding nanos caps a single tenant balance at ~$9.2B, far above any realistic cap. And the support email is split across `hello@usezombie.com` (Pricing.tsx) and `usezombie@agentmail.to` (Privacy/Terms/docs) — every contact surface should resolve to one constant per repo. Finally, the marketing pricing page (`Pricing.tsx`, `FAQ.tsx`, the docs site) still surfaces M65 rates and BYOK provider lists; without a paired update, the M66 rate change ships invisible to users.

### Solution summary

One workstream, six sections:

- **§1** rename the canonical billing unit from cents to nanos. Pre-v2.0 clean break: edit `schema/017_tenant_billing.sql` in place (column `balance_cents` → `balance_nanos`, CHECK rewritten), no migration file, no `ALTER`. Zig constants + paired pin tests follow.
- **§2** introduce M66 traction rates: `EVENT_NANOS = 0` (single, both postures), `STAGE_PLATFORM_NANOS = 1_000_000`, `STAGE_SELF_MANAGED_NANOS = 100_000`, `STARTER_CREDIT_NANOS = 5_000_000_000`. Update every consumer.
- **§3** retire the BYOK term aggressively: edit `schema/020_tenant_providers.sql` in place (the `mode` column is already `TEXT` with app-side enforcement per RULE STS — only the comment text changes), Zig `Mode.byok` → `Mode.self_managed`, log scope rename, API wire format rename (clean break — no alias), TS `Mode` type, app `ByokFields.tsx` → `ProviderKeyFields.tsx`, CLI `--byok` → `--self-managed`. Architecture docs renamed: `billing_and_byok.md` → `billing_and_provider_keys.md`, `scenarios/02_byok.md` → `scenarios/02_self_managed.md`.
- **§4** website pricing surface fix: `Pricing.tsx`, `FAQ.tsx`, `lib/rates.ts` updated for the new rates; introductory-rate framing ("stealth-mode testing rate — will rise post-GA"); platform-vs-self-managed gradient surfaced as the friction-reduction signal.
- **§5** single canonical `SUPPORT_EMAIL` constant per repo (Zig, website TS, app TS, CLI JS, docs MDX snippet) all asserting `usezombie@agentmail.to`. Paired pin tests. Sweep all `hello@usezombie.com` literals.
- **§6** documentation currency audit: walk every spec under `docs/v2/done/` and grep-confirm `~/Projects/docs/`, `docs/architecture/`, repo READMEs, and the org-profile README are aligned with what those specs actually shipped. Surface any drift; either fix in this PR (if mechanical) or file as an explicit follow-up spec.

User-visible outcome: the docs site, marketing site, dashboard, and CLI all speak one vocabulary ("self-managed provider key" or "you bring your provider and model"). The pricing page shows two stage rates with an explicit gradient, communicating "platform mode is convenient; self-managed mode is 10× cheaper to scale." Every contact surface points to `usezombie@agentmail.to`. The credit pool is denominated in nanos, leaving room for $0.00001 rates without another unit change. Dev DB is wiped + reseeded via `make down && make up` — no migration script, no `ALTER`, per the pre-v2.0 clean-break posture (RULE NLG, Schema Removal Guard pre-v2.0 path).

## Files Changed (blast radius)

| File | Action | Why |
|---|---|---|
| `schema/017_tenant_billing.sql` | EDIT (in place) | Rename column `balance_cents` → `balance_nanos`. CHECK becomes `balance_nanos >= 0`. Update file-top comment to drop M65 cents prose. **No migration file, no `ALTER`** — pre-v2.0 clean break, dev DB reseeded via `make down && make up`. |
| `schema/020_tenant_providers.sql` | EDIT (in place) | Update file-top comment: `mode ∈ {platform, byok}` → `mode ∈ {platform, self_managed}`. The `mode` column is already `TEXT` (RULE STS — value enforcement lives in `src/state/tenant_provider.zig`), so no DDL change. Update the operator-query index comment from "list all BYOK tenants" to "list all self-managed tenants". |
| `src/state/tenant_billing.zig` | EDIT | Constants renamed `_CENTS` → `_NANOS`, value set rebuilt from M66 rate table (not a value-preserving rescale). Drop `EVENT_BYOK_CENTS` and `EVENT_PLATFORM_CENTS` (collapsed into single `EVENT_NANOS = 0`). Drop single `STAGE_CENTS`; add posture-dispatched `STAGE_PLATFORM_NANOS = 1_000_000` and `STAGE_SELF_MANAGED_NANOS = 100_000`. `STARTER_CREDIT_NANOS = 5_000_000_000`. Column type stays `BIGINT` (i64). |
| `src/state/tenant_billing_test.zig` | EDIT | Pin tests for all new constants. New negative test: parsing legacy `'byok'` string into `Mode` returns `error.UnknownMode`. |
| `src/state/tenant_provider.zig` | EDIT | `Mode.byok` → `Mode.self_managed`. Update `displayName()`, `parse()`, every match arm. |

| `docs/architecture/billing_and_byok.md` → `docs/architecture/billing_and_provider_keys.md` | RENAME (`git mv`) | File rename. Body §0 vocabulary preamble updated to record the BYOK retirement; §1 prose rewrites BYOK → self-managed. Historical note preserves the lineage. |
| `docs/architecture/scenarios/02_byok.md` → `docs/architecture/scenarios/02_self_managed.md` | RENAME (`git mv`) | File rename. Body sweep. Update intra-doc links from peer scenarios. |

| `README.md` (repo root) | EDIT | "Markdown-defined. BYOK." → "Markdown-defined. Self-managed provider keys." |
| `ui/packages/website/src/lib/rates.ts` | EDIT | Drop `RATES_CENTS` object wrapper. Export named constants matching Zig identifier-for-identifier: `STARTER_CREDIT_NANOS = 5_000_000_000n`, `EVENT_NANOS = 0n`, `STAGE_PLATFORM_NANOS = 1_000_000n`, `STAGE_SELF_MANAGED_NANOS = 100_000n` (BigInt to preserve precision past `Number.MAX_SAFE_INTEGER`). Drop `eventByok` / nested-object shape. Display strings live in a paired `RATES_DISPLAY` map keyed by the same role names (`STARTER_CREDIT`, `EVENT_RATE`, `STAGE_PLATFORM`, `STAGE_SELF_MANAGED`) — see **Naming convention (cross-tier)** below. |

## Sections (implementation slices)

### §1 — Nanos unit (clean break, pre-v2.0)

Switch the canonical billing unit from cents (`i64`) to **nanos (1/1,000,000,000 USD = 9 decimal places)**. Pre-v2.0 RULE NLG + Schema Removal Guard pre-v2.0 path → **edit the existing schema file in place; no migration script; no `ALTER`.**

**Procedure:**
1. Edit `schema/017_tenant_billing.sql`: rename column declaration `balance_cents BIGINT NOT NULL CHECK (balance_cents >= 0)` → `balance_nanos BIGINT NOT NULL CHECK (balance_nanos >= 0)`. Update the file-top comment to drop M65 cents prose.
2. Reseed dev DB: `make down && make up` (this re-runs every `schema/*.sql` from a clean Postgres). The Schema Removal Guard pre-v2.0 path is the canonical procedure here — see `docs/gates/schema-removal.md`.
3. Update Zig constants in `src/state/tenant_billing.zig`: rename `_CENTS` → `_NANOS`, rebuild values from the M66 rate table. Update every reference to `balance_cents` across `src/` to `balance_nanos`.
4. Update paired pin test in `src/state/tenant_billing_test.zig`.
5. Update TS mirror `ui/packages/website/src/lib/rates.ts` per the cross-tier naming table.

**Why nanos, not micros:** micros (1/1,000,000 USD = 6 decimals) bottom out at $0.000001. Nanos give 3 more decimals of headroom, enough to express $0.000000001 (one billionth) cleanly. `i64` BIGINT holding nanos caps a single tenant balance at ~$9.2 billion (`i64::MAX` = 9.22e18 nanos = ~9.22e9 USD), so the type has no realistic overflow risk.

**Why no `ALTER`:** pre-v2.0 has no production data to preserve. Adding a migration script just to rescale a column on an empty dev DB would (a) need maintenance for the lifetime of the repo, (b) couple the rate change to migration plumbing that doesn't exist post-v2.0 either (we'd build it once and never use it), and (c) violate RULE NLG by carrying legacy framing into pre-v2.0 code. Edit the schema file, reseed, move on. When v2.0.0 ships, the Schema Removal Guard switches to the migration-required path automatically.

### Naming convention (cross-tier)

**Role names are identical across Zig, TypeScript, and Mintlify snippets.** RULE CTM (cross-tier mirroring) is load-bearing here — a renamed constant in one tier without the others drifts silently and is exactly the kind of bug paired pin tests are designed to catch.

| Role | Zig (`tenant_billing.zig`) | TS (`lib/rates.ts`) | Docs (`snippets/rates.mdx`) |
|---|---|---|---|
| Starter credit | `STARTER_CREDIT_NANOS` | `STARTER_CREDIT_NANOS` | `STARTER_CREDIT` |
| Event charge | `EVENT_NANOS` | `EVENT_NANOS` | `EVENT_RATE` |
| Stage charge (platform) | `STAGE_PLATFORM_NANOS` | `STAGE_PLATFORM_NANOS` | `STAGE_PLATFORM` |
| Stage charge (self-managed) | `STAGE_SELF_MANAGED_NANOS` | `STAGE_SELF_MANAGED_NANOS` | `STAGE_SELF_MANAGED` |

**Suffix rule:**
- `_NANOS` suffix on raw-integer constants (Zig, TS) — the underlying unit. The value is the same `i64`/`bigint` integer in both languages.
- Bare role name on Mintlify display snippets — the value is the user-facing `$`-formatted string (`"$5"`, `"free"`, `"$0.001"`). The display layer's job is presentation, not unit math.

**Pin tests assert role-name parity in both directions:**
- `src/state/tenant_billing_test.zig` asserts each Zig constant by name + value.
- `ui/packages/website/src/lib/rates.test.ts` asserts each TS export by name + value AND asserts the integer values match the Zig-side numbers (hard-coded literal mirror, with a comment pointing back to `tenant_billing.zig`).
- `~/Projects/docs/snippets/rates.test.mdx` (or equivalent docs-CI check, if introduced this milestone) asserts the four display keys exist and resolve to the expected `$`-strings.

A renamed role triggers test failures in **all three** layers, not just one.

### §2 — M66 traction rates

Replace the M65 rate constants with M66 values. New constant set:
- `STARTER_CREDIT_NANOS = 5_000_000_000` ($5)
- `EVENT_NANOS = 0` (single value, both postures)
- `STAGE_PLATFORM_NANOS = 1_000_000` ($0.001 — usezombie pays Fireworks for tokens)
- `STAGE_SELF_MANAGED_NANOS = 100_000` ($0.0001 — user pays their own provider)

Drop `EVENT_PLATFORM_CENTS`, `EVENT_BYOK_CENTS`, `STAGE_CENTS` (the single cross-mode constant). Update `compute_*_charge` functions in `tenant_billing.zig` to dispatch on posture for stage cost.

The platform/self-managed gradient is the friction-reducer: on-ramp on platform mode without bringing a key; graduate to self-managed for 10× cheaper stages once the user is serious. Document this in the `<Update>` block as a deliberate stealth-mode subsidy.

### §3 — BYOK term retirement (every tier)

Rename in lockstep across schema, Zig, API wire format, TS, app components, CLI, architecture docs.

**Implementation default:** use `git mv` for file renames to preserve history. **No DDL change for the `mode` column** — `core.tenant_providers.mode` is `TEXT` with app-side enforcement per RULE STS (see `schema/020_tenant_providers.sql:12-14` comment). Value-set drift lives entirely in `src/state/tenant_provider.zig`'s `Mode` enum + `parse()` function. The schema file's only edit is the prose comment switch from `byok` → `self_managed`. Dev DB reseed via `make down && make up`.

**Clean break — no alias:** the API rejects `mode: "byok"` with HTTP 400 + `UZ-PROVIDER-MODE-RENAMED` (replacement hint = `"self_managed"`). The CLI rejects `--byok` with stderr message naming the new flag. Pre-v2.0 RULE NLG forbids legacy scaffolding.

### §4 — Website pricing surface fix

Update `Pricing.tsx`, `FAQ.tsx`, `lib/rates.ts` to surface the new rates. Pricing card displays two stage rates side-by-side with the friction-reduction framing ("$0.001/stage on platform default, $0.0001/stage when you bring your own provider key — 10× cheaper to scale"). Drop the BYOK provider-list paragraph; the diagram below already names providers. Stealth-mode banner lands in the Pricing card itself (already shipped via PR #311; this section keeps it consistent with the new rates).

**Introductory-rate framing:** the rate line carries a small subscript "stealth-mode testing rate — will rise post-GA" so future ratchets are expected behavior, not surprise price hikes.

### §5 — Single canonical SUPPORT_EMAIL per repo

Five new constant files (one per repo / package) all asserting `usezombie@agentmail.to`:
- `src/config/contact.zig`
- `ui/packages/website/src/lib/contact.ts`
- `ui/packages/app/lib/contact.ts`
- `zombiectl/src/lib/contact.js`
- `~/Projects/docs/snippets/contact.mdx`

Paired pin test in each repo asserts the exact string. Sweep replaces every `hello@usezombie.com` literal with the constant import. The org-profile README (`~/Projects/.github/profile/README.md`) carries a single literal (markdown can't import).

### §6 — Documentation currency audit

Before merging, walk every spec under `docs/v2/done/` and grep-confirm:
- `~/Projects/docs/` (Mintlify site) prose aligns with what shipped.
- `docs/architecture/` (in-repo) reflects the current runtime shape.
- Repo READMEs (`usezombie/README.md`, `zombiectl/README.md`, architecture `README.md`) are current.
- Org profile (`~/Projects/.github/profile/README.md`) is current.

Any drift is either (a) fixed in this PR (mechanical wording fixes) or (b) filed as an explicit follow-up spec under `docs/v2/pending/M66_NNN_DOCS_DRIFT_*.md`. The Discovery section captures every drift finding before close.

## Interfaces

### HTTP — `PUT /v1/tenants/me/provider`

**Before (M65):** request `{ "mode": "platform" | "byok", "credential_ref"?: string }`.
**After (M66):** request `{ "mode": "platform" | "self_managed", "credential_ref"?: string }`.

`mode: "byok"` returns:
```
HTTP/1.1 400 Bad Request
Content-Type: application/problem+json

{
  "type": "https://docs.usezombie.com/errors/UZ-PROVIDER-MODE-RENAMED",
  "title": "Provider mode 'byok' was renamed to 'self_managed'",
  "status": 400,
  "code": "UZ-PROVIDER-MODE-RENAMED",
  "replacement": "self_managed"
}
```

### CLI — `zombiectl tenant provider set`

**Before (M65):** `--byok <credential>` flag.
**After (M66):** `--self-managed <credential>`. `--byok` → stderr error + exit 2:

```
zombiectl: --byok was renamed to --self-managed in M66.
See https://docs.usezombie.com/zombies/credentials.
```

### Schema — `core.tenant_providers.mode` and `billing.tenant_billing`

**Before:** `core.tenant_providers.mode TEXT` with comment-documented value-set `{platform, byok}`; value enforcement in `src/state/tenant_provider.zig` (RULE STS — no static-string CHECKs). `billing.tenant_billing.balance_cents BIGINT NOT NULL CHECK (balance_cents >= 0)`.

**After:** `core.tenant_providers.mode TEXT` with comment-documented value-set `{platform, self_managed}`; value enforcement still in `Mode.parse()` — schema-side change is comment-only. `billing.tenant_billing.balance_nanos BIGINT NOT NULL CHECK (balance_nanos >= 0)`.

**Procedure:** in-place edit of `schema/017_tenant_billing.sql` and `schema/020_tenant_providers.sql` per §1's pre-v2.0 clean-break path. **No migration script, no `ALTER`, no rescaling step.** Dev DB is reseeded via `make down && make up`; CI starts from clean Postgres so the schema change is invisible there. See `docs/gates/schema-removal.md` pre-v2.0 path.

### TS — `Mode` type alias

**Before:** `type Mode = "platform" | "byok"`.
**After:** `type Mode = "platform" | "self_managed"`.

---

## Failure Modes

| Mode | Cause | Handling | Test |
|---|---|---|---|
| Old client sends `mode: "byok"` | Pre-M66 SDK / cached client / curl from a runbook | HTTP 400 + `UZ-PROVIDER-MODE-RENAMED` with `replacement: "self_managed"`. No alias. | `test_provider_mode_byok_returns_400_with_replacement` |
| TS Mode parser receives `"byok"` from API | Stale client cache / network race during cutover | Strict TypeScript union → parse error → toast. No silent coerce. | `test_mode_parser_rejects_byok` |
| CLI --byok flag passed | User following old docs / shell history | Stderr error with replacement flag name; non-zero exit. | `test_cli_legacy_byok_flag_emits_error` |
| Dev DB still holds pre-M66 column shape after pulling this branch | Developer didn't reseed | Pre-v2.0 procedure: `make down && make up` after merge. Schema files are the source of truth; no migration runner. CI starts from clean Postgres so this only affects local dev. | n/a — documented in PR Session Notes; no test (clean-slate is the contract) |
| Saved Grafana dashboards keyed on `byok_credential_*` log scopes | Log scope rename | Listed in Discovery; saved-search update is a follow-up doc-only change. Not blocking. | n/a — operational |
| Architecture-doc intra-doc links broken after `git mv` | `[link](billing_and_byok.md)` references in peer docs | DOC READ GATE on `docs/architecture/**` catches unfixed links during execute; sweep listed in §3. | `test_arch_doc_links_resolve` (grep-based) |
| Frontend `data-testid` rename breaks downstream e2e | Out-of-repo e2e suite depends on `provider-byok-*` IDs | Inventory all references during Discovery; flag any out-of-repo dependency in spec body before CHORE(open). | `test_provider_selector_test_ids_renamed` |
| Pin tests drift between Zig and TS rates | Cross-tier mirror not enforced | Paired pin tests in `tenant_billing_test.zig` and `rates.test.ts` assert the exact same values. CI fails on drift. | `test_rates_pinned_zig` + `test_rates_pinned_ts` |

---

## Invariants

1. **No surface mentions BYOK except named exemptions.** Enforced by `make lint` step that greps `\bBYOK\b` against `src/`, `ui/`, `zombiectl/`, `public/`, `docs/architecture/` and asserts zero hits. Allowlist file lists the architecture-doc historical-note line and the docs-site changelog archive.
2. **Both rate constants are pinned identically across Zig + TS.** Enforced by paired test asserting exact i64 values match.
3. **`SUPPORT_EMAIL` is `usezombie@agentmail.to` everywhere.** Enforced by per-repo pin test asserting the exact string + `make lint` step grepping for `hello@usezombie.com` and asserting zero hits.
4. **`mode` value-set is exactly `{platform, self_managed}` and lives in app code.** `core.tenant_providers.mode` stays `TEXT` (RULE STS — no static-string CHECKs). Enforced by `Mode.parse()` in `src/state/tenant_provider.zig` + the parse-fails-on-byok pin test.
5. **`Mode.parse("byok")` returns `error.UnknownMode`.** Enforced by Zig pin test.
6. **API responses always serialize `mode` as `"platform"` or `"self_managed"` — never `"byok"`.** Enforced by integration test on `GET /v1/tenants/me/provider`.

| `test_pricing_renders_two_stage_rates` | `Pricing.tsx` test asserts both `pricing-rate-stage-platform` and `pricing-rate-stage-self-managed` test IDs render with $0.001 / $0.0001 strings. |
| `test_pricing_renders_introductory_rate_subscript` | Pricing card shows "stealth-mode testing rate — will rise post-GA". |
| `test_pricing_drops_byok_provider_list` | `screen.queryByText(/BYOK on/)` returns null. |
| `test_provider_selector_test_ids_renamed` | All `provider-byok-*` test IDs absent; `provider-self-managed-*` present. |
| `test_provider_key_fields_component_renamed` | `import { ProviderKeyFields }` resolves; `import { ByokFields }` is a TypeScript error. |
| `test_support_email_pinned_zig` | `src/config/contact_test.zig` asserts `SUPPORT_EMAIL == "usezombie@agentmail.to"` |
| `test_support_email_pinned_ts_website` | `ui/packages/website/src/lib/contact.test.ts` same assertion. |
| `test_support_email_pinned_ts_app` | Same in app. |
| `test_support_email_pinned_cli` | Same in CLI. |
| `test_no_hello_at_usezombie_dot_com_literal_remains` | grep `hello@usezombie.com` against full repo returns zero hits (allowlist: changelog archives if any). |
| `test_no_byok_term_in_active_source` | grep `\bBYOK\b` against active source/copy returns zero hits (allowlist: arch-doc historical note line, docs-site changelog archive). |
| `test_arch_doc_links_resolve` | grep all `[label](*.md)` references in `docs/architecture/**` and assert each target exists. |

## Dead Code Sweep

**1. Orphaned files — must be deleted from disk and git:**

| File to delete | Verify deleted |
|---|---|
| `docs/architecture/billing_and_byok.md` (renamed via `git mv`) | `test ! -f docs/architecture/billing_and_byok.md` |
| `docs/architecture/scenarios/02_byok.md` (renamed via `git mv`) | `test ! -f docs/architecture/scenarios/02_byok.md` |
| `ui/packages/app/.../components/ByokFields.tsx` (renamed via `git mv`) | `test ! -f ui/packages/app/app/(dashboard)/settings/provider/components/ByokFields.tsx` |

## Discovery (consult log)

(Empty at spec creation — populated as Legacy-Design Consult Guard, Architecture Consult, and other action-triggered guards fire during EXECUTE.)

Expected entries:
- Inventory of `provider-byok-*` data-testid usage (out-of-repo e2e dependency check) before §3 begins.
- Confirmation that `make down && make up` is the canonical reseed path on this dev environment (Schema Removal Guard pre-v2.0 procedure), captured before §1 lands.
- Documentation drift findings from §6 audit; either fixed in PR or filed as follow-up specs.

## Skill-Driven Review Chain (mandatory)

| When | Skill | What it does | Required output |
|---|---|---|---|
| After implementation, before CHORE(close) | `/write-unit-test` | Audits diff coverage against this spec's Test Specification. Catches happy-path-only tests, missing negatives, fixture drift. | Skill returns clean. Iteration count + final coverage summary in PR Session Notes. |
| After tests pass, still before CHORE(close) | `/review` | Adversarial diff review against this spec, `docs/architecture/billing_and_provider_keys.md`, `docs/REST_API_DESIGN_GUIDELINES.md` (handler), `docs/ZIG_RULES.md`, Failure Modes, Invariants. | Skill returns clean OR every finding dispositioned. |
| After `gh pr create` opens the PR | `/review-pr` | Review-comments the open PR against the now-immutable diff. | Comments addressed inline before requesting human review or merging. |
| After every push | `kishore-babysit-prs` | Polls Greptile per cadence, walks every review id, triages P0/P1 vs RULES.md, fixes+replies+reschedules. Stops on two consecutive empty polls. | Final report in PR Session Notes. |

## Out of Scope

- **TEMPLATE.md determinism upgrades** (the seven-point list from the M66 proposal). Filed as future work; orthogonal to BYOK / rates / email.
- **Grafana saved-search rename** for `byok_credential_*` log scopes. Listed in §6 Discovery; will be a follow-up doc-only branch updating saved queries, not blocking on this spec.
- **Schema column rename `posture`/`mode` if applicable.** Existing column name preserved; only the enum value changes.
- **Public docs publishing of `UZ-PROVIDER-MODE-RENAMED` error code page on docs.usezombie.com.** Error registry update lands in this spec; the docs page lands in the paired docs PR's `<Update>` block.
- **Currency / locale display formatting.** All rates render in USD; localization is future work.
- **Volume-tier pricing or post-GA ratchet schedule.** Captured as a marketing/strategy decision; not in this spec.
