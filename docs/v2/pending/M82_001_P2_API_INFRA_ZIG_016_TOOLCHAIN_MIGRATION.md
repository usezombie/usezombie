# M82_001: Migrate the toolchain from Zig 0.15.2 to 0.16.0

**Prototype:** v2.0.0
**Milestone:** M82
**Workstream:** 001
**Date:** Jun 02, 2026
**Status:** PENDING
**Priority:** P2 — toolchain bump, no customer-facing behaviour change; parked until a forcing function pulls it.
**Categories:** API, INFRA
**Batch:** B1 — runs first; M82_002 (`std.http.Client`/auth rewrite) is B2, gated on this clearing.
**Branch:** {feat/m82-zig-016-toolchain — added when work begins}
**Depends on:** None hard. Sequenced PENDING behind M80 (runner fleet) completion — see Overview for the forcing-function trigger.
**Provenance:** agent-generated (pre-spec, `spike/zig-0.16-feasibility` — feasibility proven: full dependency graph compiles on 0.16, only mechanical `std` renames remain in our own source)

> **Provenance is load-bearing.** This spec was authored from a live spike, not from reading alone. The dependency-graph claims (§1) are compile-verified on the spike branch; the source-migration counts (§2–§3) are `git grep` calibrations, not estimates. Re-verify the counts at PLAN — they drift as `main` advances.

**Canonical architecture:** Greenfield for the wall-clock abstraction (`src/lib/common/clock.zig` — no existing clock helper; all sites call `std.time.*` directly today). No `docs/architecture/` doc governs toolchain pinning; dependency-pin conventions live as comments in `build.zig.zon` and `vendor/*/CHANGES.md`.

---

## Implementing agent — read these first

1. `spike/zig-0.16-feasibility` branch (this repo) — the proven foundation. `build.zig.zon` re-pins, `vendor/httpz/` re-vendor + UAF patch, `vendor/zig-yaml/` fork are already built there. Batch 1 starts by reconciling this branch onto a fresh feature branch, NOT from scratch.
2. `vendor/httpz/CHANGES.md` — the UAF patch contract (stop-before-deinit in non-blocking `Worker.deinit`). The patch is verified still-required on upstream's `zig-0.16` branch; it must port forward verbatim.
3. `docs/ZIG_RULES.md` + `docs/greptile-learnings/RULES.md` (RULE ZAL, ORP, XCC, UFS) — the Zig discipline this diff trips; RULE ZAL is itself 0.15-pinned and must be reconciled (§5).
4. `playbooks/013_ci_zig_images/` — the `ci-zig-*` image bake process; `versions.env` is the single source of truth for the pinned Zig version + SHAs.
5. https://ziglang.org/download/0.16.0/release-notes.html — the canonical list of removed/reshaped `std` APIs (`std.time.milliTimestamp`/`nanoTimestamp` removal → Io `Clock`; `GeneralPurposeAllocator` → `DebugAllocator`; `fixedBufferStream` → `Io.Writer.fixed`).

---

## PR Intent & comprehension handshake

- **PR title (eventual):** `build(m82): migrate toolchain to Zig 0.16.0 (deps, std renames, CI)`
- **Intent (one sentence):** Move the entire build off Zig 0.15.2 onto 0.16.0 — every dependency, our own source, and CI — with zero behaviour change, so the codebase tracks the current stable toolchain.
- **Handshake (agent fills at PLAN, before EXECUTE):** restate intent; list `ASSUMPTIONS I'M MAKING:`. A mismatch with the Intent above → STOP and reconcile before any edit. Re-run the §2/§3 calibration greps — the call-site counts below are point-in-time.

---

## Applicable Rules

- **`docs/greptile-learnings/RULES.md`** — universal. Specifically trips:
  - **RULE ORP** (cross-layer orphan sweep) — the `milliTimestamp`/`nanoTimestamp`→`clock` redirect is a repo-wide rename; orphan sweep must show **0** residual `std.time.milliTimestamp`/`nanoTimestamp` in `src/`.
  - **RULE ZAL** (Zig 0.15 ArrayList API) — **this rule is 0.15-pinned and this migration obsoletes it.** Reconcile, do not silently violate (§5). Spec-vs-rule conflict resolved by amending the rule, per the migration's nature.
  - **RULE XCC** (cross-compile before commit) — both Linux targets must build on 0.16.
  - **RULE UFS** (string/numeric literals are constants) — the pinned Zig version + SHAs are single-sourced in `versions.env`; the clock unit conversions use named `std.time.ns_per_ms` constants, not magic numbers.
  - **RULE TST-NAM / milestone-free code** — no `M82`/`§` IDs in any `.zig`/`.sh`/test name.
  - **RULE NDC / NLR / NLG** — no dead code at write time; vendor `CHANGES.md` uses "drop when upstream lands" framing (not "legacy"), pre-2.0 compliant.
  - **RULE IMS** — `[]const u8` for immutable data through the clock/format edits.
- **`docs/ZIG_RULES.md`** — all `*.zig` edits: pg-drain lifecycle (untouched here), tagged-union results, multi-step `errdefer`, cross-compile.
- **`docs/LOGGING_STANDARD.md`** — the logging hot path (`src/lib/logging/mod.zig`) changes how it sources the timestamp; emit shape must not change.
- **`docs/LIFECYCLE_PATTERNS.md`** — `vendor/httpz` `Worker.deinit` (the UAF patch) and the new `clock.zig` init/deinit-free shape.

---

## Applicable Gates

| Gate | Fires? | Satisfaction strategy |
|------|--------|-----------------------|
| ZIG GATE | **yes** — pervasive `*.zig` edits | Read `docs/ZIG_RULES.md`; cross-compile both linux targets (RULE XCC) before commit. |
| PUB / Struct-Shape | **yes** — new `src/lib/common/clock.zig` pub surface | Own shape verdict: free-function module (`nowMillis`/`nowNanos`), no struct/inheritance; `zlint unused-decls` covers consumer-grep. |
| File & Function Length (≤350/≤50/≤70) | **yes** — new file + net-adds across the sweep | `clock.zig` is tiny; the timestamp sweep is in-place substitution (no net growth). Watch `logging/mod.zig` and `metrics_workspace.zig` near caps. |
| UFS (repeated/semantic literals) | **yes** — pinned version/SHA, clock unit math | Version + SHAs single-sourced in `versions.env`; unit conversions via `std.time.ns_per_ms`/`ms_per_s` named constants. |
| LOGGING | **yes** — `logging/mod.zig` timestamp source change | Emit envelope shape and fields unchanged; only the timestamp *source* swaps to `clock`. |
| LIFECYCLE | **yes** — httpz `Worker.deinit` patch + new module | UAF patch re-applied verbatim; `clock.zig` holds no heap/handle (no init/deinit). |
| MILESTONE-ID | **yes** — source/config edits outside `docs/` | No `M82`/`§`/dim IDs in code, tests, workflows (RULE TST-NAM). |
| SCHEMA / ERROR REGISTRY / UI / DESIGN TOKEN | **no** | No schema, no new error codes (http.Client errors deferred to M82_002), no UI. |

## Overview

**Goal (testable):** `zig build`, `make test`, `make test-integration`, `make memleak`, and `zig build -Dtarget={x86_64,aarch64}-linux` all pass on Zig 0.16.0 with zero `std.time.milliTimestamp`/`nanoTimestamp` references remaining in `src/`, and CI runs the `:0.16.0` images.

**Problem:** The toolchain is pinned to Zig 0.15.2 while 0.16.0 is the current stable (released Apr 13, 2026). Our own libraries (`posthog-zig`, `nullclaw`) have already moved to 0.16; staying on 0.15.2 splits the toolchain across the org and blocks adopting any 0.16-only dependency. There is no behaviour to change — this is pure toolchain currency.

**Solution summary:** Re-pin every dependency to its 0.16-compatible revision (two needing a vendored fork — `httpz`, `zig-yaml`), introduce a single `clock` helper to absorb the removal of `std.time.milliTimestamp`/`nanoTimestamp`, mechanically redirect ~206 wall-clock call sites to it, apply the handful of remaining `std` renames (`DebugAllocator`, `Io.Writer.fixed`, unmanaged HashMaps), and cut CI over to freshly-baked `:0.16.0` images. The `std.http.Client` rewrite touches the auth boundary and is split into M82_002.

**Forcing-function trigger (why PENDING, not active):** This is a no-deadline migration with real churn and one runtime risk (upstream's `http.zig` 0.16 branch self-describes as experimental). It flips to active when **any** of: a dependency we want goes 0.16-only · a measured 0.16 perf/footprint win we need · `http.zig`'s 0.16 branch sheds the "experimental" label · M80 (runner fleet) wraps and a cleanup window opens.

---

## Prior-Art / Reference Implementations

- **Dependency forks** → `vendor/httpz/` is the established in-repo pattern (verbatim upstream copy + documented `CHANGES.md` patch). `vendor/zig-yaml/` mirrors it exactly. Alignment: identical structure; divergence: none.
- **Our own 0.16 migrations** → `usezombie/posthog-zig` v0.2.0 and `nullclaw` v2026.5.29 are the reference for the `std.Io`/Clock idioms (posthog's `init` gained an `io` param; mirror that call-site shape at `src/zombied/cmd/preflight.zig`).
- **Clock helper** → no prior art in-repo; greenfield. Shape it as a minimal free-function module wrapping the 0.16 wall-clock primitive (Io `Clock` via a retained process `Io`, or direct syscall) — decided at PLAN against the 0.16 release notes.

---

## Files Changed (blast radius)

> The timestamp redirect spans ~95 files; enumerating each is impractical and drift-prone, so it is scoped by a **deterministic command** rather than a static list. The agent may edit any `src/**/*.zig` returned by that grep without further override — that IS the scoped set.

| File | Action | Why |
|------|--------|-----|
| `build.zig.zon` | EDIT | Re-pin all deps to 0.16 revs; `minimum_zig_version` → 0.16.0 |
| `vendor/httpz/**` | EDIT | Re-vendor from upstream `zig-0.16` branch (40be022); re-apply UAF stop-before-deinit patch |
| `vendor/zig-yaml/**` | CREATE | New vendored fork; library source 0.16-clean, conformance harness dropped from its `build.zig` |
| `src/lib/common/clock.zig` | CREATE | The wall-clock helper (`nowMillis`/`nowNanos`) absorbing the `std.time.*` removal |
| `src/lib/common/constants.zig` | EDIT | Export the clock module via the `common` named module (Zig boundary law) |
| `all src/**/*.zig` matching `git grep -l 'std\.time\.\(milli\|nano\)Timestamp'` | EDIT | Mechanical redirect to `clock.nowMillis`/`nowNanos` (~95 files — the orphan grep IS the scope) |
| `src/lib/logging/mod.zig`, `envelope.zig` | EDIT | Timestamp source → `clock`; `fixedBufferStream` → `Io.Writer.fixed` |
| `src/zombied/observability/metrics_workspace.zig`, `metrics_runner_test.zig`, `cmd/doctor.zig` | EDIT | `fixedBufferStream` → `Io.Writer.fixed` |
| `src/zombied/main.zig` | EDIT | `GeneralPurposeAllocator` → `DebugAllocator`; clock for log timestamps |
| `src/zombied/cmd/preflight.zig` | EDIT | `posthog.init` gains the `io` param (v0.2.0 signature) |
| `.github/workflows/{test,lint,memleak,bench,cross-compile,deploy-dev,release,test-integration}.yml` | EDIT | `:0.15.2` image tags + `setup-zig` version → `0.16.0` (9 files) |
| `playbooks/013_ci_zig_images/versions.env` | EDIT | `ZIG_VERSION` 0.15.2 → 0.16.0 + four new SHA256s; rebuild/push the three base images |
| `docs/greptile-learnings/RULES.md` | EDIT | Reconcile RULE ZAL (0.15 ArrayList API → 0.16) — §5 |

## Decomposition & alternatives (patch vs refactor)

- **Chosen shape:** Two workstreams. **M82_001 (this, B1)** = deps + mechanical `std` migration + clock helper + CI. **M82_002 (B2)** = the `std.http.Client` rewrite, split out because it touches the auth boundary (`clerk_backend`, `jwks`) — per the rule that security-boundary follow-ups get their own spec+PR, not folded into a mechanical-cleanup diff. Within B1, the clock migration is its own Section because it is the single largest and riskiest mechanical change (orphan-sweep discipline).
- **Alternatives considered:** (a) **One mega-PR** including `http.Client` — rejected: a ~95-file mechanical diff plus an auth-surface rewrite is unreviewable and violates the security-split rule. (b) **Thread `std.Io` through every timestamp call site** instead of a clock helper — rejected: that propagates `io` parameters through ~95 files and up their call trees, a far larger and more invasive diff than a single localized helper. (c) **Don't vendor zig-yaml; pin upstream main** — rejected: upstream's broken conformance harness breaks our build (proven on the spike); vendoring is the only way to consume the clean library today.
- **Patch-vs-refactor verdict:** this is a **patch** (toolchain currency, behaviour-preserving) with one small **new abstraction** (the clock helper) that is itself the minimal change. The larger refactor — adopting `std.Io` as a first-class threaded dependency across the daemon — is real future work but explicitly out of scope; named in Out of Scope.

## Sections (implementation slices)

### §1 — Dependency graph on 0.16

Re-pin every dependency to a 0.16-compatible revision and stand the two fork-requiring deps back up. This is the foundation; nothing else compiles until it lands. **Implementation default:** reconcile the proven `spike/zig-0.16-feasibility` branch onto the feature branch rather than re-deriving — the SHAs and patches are already verified there.

- **Dimension 1.1** — `build.zig.zon` re-pinned (nullclaw v2026.5.29, pg.zig 0.16 master commit, posthog v0.2.0, zbench `zig-0.16.0` branch) and `minimum_zig_version = "0.16.0"` → Test `test_dep_graph_resolves_on_016`
- **Dimension 1.2** — `vendor/httpz/` re-vendored from upstream `zig-0.16` (40be022); UAF stop-before-deinit patch present in non-blocking `Worker.deinit` → Test `test_httpz_worker_deinit_stops_pool`
- **Dimension 1.3** — `vendor/zig-yaml/` fork: library `yaml` module compiles; conformance-test wiring removed from its `build.zig` → Test `test_yaml_frontmatter_parses_on_016`
- **Dimension 1.4** — `posthog.init` call at `preflight.zig` passes the v0.2.0 `io` parameter → Test `test_telemetry_init_compiles_with_io`

### §2 — Wall-clock migration (keystone)

`std.time.milliTimestamp`/`nanoTimestamp` are removed in 0.16. Introduce one clock helper and redirect every site. This is the largest mechanical change and the one most exposed to RULE ORP (a missed site = silent build break or, worse, a residual that no longer compiles). **Implementation default:** a free-function `clock` module wrapping the 0.16 wall-clock primitive — the agent picks Io-`Clock`-via-retained-`Io` vs direct syscall at PLAN from the release notes, whichever localizes blast radius.

- **Dimension 2.1** — `src/lib/common/clock.zig` exposes `nowMillis() i64` and `nowNanos() i128` over the 0.16 primitive, unit math via `std.time.ns_per_ms` constants → Test `test_clock_now_millis_is_wall_time`
- **Dimension 2.2** — all 175 `std.time.milliTimestamp()` sites redirected to `clock.nowMillis()`; orphan sweep clean → Test `test_no_residual_milli_timestamp`
- **Dimension 2.3** — all 31 `std.time.nanoTimestamp()` sites redirected to `clock.nowNanos()`; orphan sweep clean → Test `test_no_residual_nano_timestamp`
- **Dimension 2.4** — logging hot path (`logging/mod.zig`) sources its envelope timestamp from `clock`, emit shape unchanged → Test `test_log_envelope_timestamp_via_clock`

### §3 — Remaining mechanical std renames

The small, well-bounded 0.16 renames. Each is a verbatim substitution surfaced by a grep.

- **Dimension 3.1** — `std.heap.GeneralPurposeAllocator` → `std.heap.DebugAllocator` (3 sites) → Test `test_builds_with_debug_allocator`
- **Dimension 3.2** — `std.io.fixedBufferStream` → `std.Io.Writer.fixed` (10 sites: logging/metrics/doctor) → Test `test_fixed_writer_emits_expected_bytes`
- **Dimension 3.3** — `StringHashMap`/`AutoHashMap` unmanaged-API reconciliation (~6 sites) → Test `test_hashmap_unmanaged_round_trip`
- **Dimension 3.4** — ArrayList 0.16 API reconciled across the diff (RULE ZAL surface) → Test `test_arraylist_016_api_compiles`

### §4 — CI / infra cutover

Cut the build pipeline over to 0.16. The `ci-zig-*` images are self-baked, so the image bump precedes the workflow flip.

- **Dimension 4.1** — `versions.env` → `ZIG_VERSION=0.16.0` + four refreshed SHA256s; the three base images (alpine/ubuntu/debian-trixie) rebuilt and pushed → Test `test_ci_images_pin_016`
- **Dimension 4.2** — all 9 workflow files flipped (`:0.15.2`→`:0.16.0` image tags + `mlugg/setup-zig` `version:` lines); no `0.15.2` string remains → Test `test_no_residual_0152_in_ci`
- **Dimension 4.3** — cross-compile both targets green on 0.16 (RULE XCC) → Test `test_cross_compile_both_linux_targets`

### §5 — Rule reconciliation

RULE ZAL is explicitly "Zig 0.15 ArrayList API." Leaving it post-migration is a standing contradiction. Amend the rule (the migration is the legitimate reason to change the constant).

- **Dimension 5.1** — RULE ZAL updated in `docs/greptile-learnings/RULES.md` to the 0.16 ArrayList API (or retired with a pointer), no "0.15" references stranded → Test `test_rule_zal_references_016`
- **Dimension 5.2** — zig-yaml fix upstreamed: PR opened against `kubkon/zig-yaml` to fix `test/spec.zig` for 0.16 (parallel, external — tracked in Discovery, NOT gating this PR) → tracked, no in-repo test

---

## Interfaces

```
# New module — src/lib/common/clock.zig (exported via the `common` named module)
pub fn nowMillis() i64;   // wall-clock milliseconds since Unix epoch (replaces std.time.milliTimestamp)
pub fn nowNanos() i128;   // wall-clock nanoseconds since Unix epoch (replaces std.time.nanoTimestamp)

# build.zig.zon — pinned revisions (exact SHAs/hashes from the spike branch)
nullclaw  → ref=v2026.5.29
pg        → ref=master#<0.16 commit>   (pinned commit, never a moving branch — existing convention)
posthog   → #v0.2.0
zbench    → ref=zig-0.16.0
httpz     → path=vendor/httpz          (re-vendored zig-0.16 @ 40be022 + UAF patch)
zig_yaml  → path=vendor/zig-yaml       (forked main @ 84d747b, conformance step dropped)

# vendor/httpz/src/worker.zig — non-blocking Worker.deinit MUST contain, before the arena free:
self.thread_pool.stop();
self.thread_pool.deinit();
```

Contract: `clock.nowMillis()`/`nowNanos()` return the SAME epoch semantics as the removed `std.time.*` functions — drop-in replacements, no caller-visible behaviour change. The httpz patch is an invariant, not a suggestion (§Invariants).

---

## Failure Modes

| Mode | Cause | Handling (system response + what the caller observes) |
|------|-------|--------------------------------------------------------|
| httpz shutdown UAF regression | UAF patch dropped/mis-ported during re-vendor | `make memleak` + integration teardown on Linux non-blocking loop SIGSEGV/leak-reports; CI red before merge |
| Missed timestamp site | A `std.time.*` call not redirected | Build fails (symbol removed) OR orphan sweep `test_no_residual_*` shows >0; gate blocks |
| Wrong clock epoch/unit | Helper returns monotonic ns or wrong scale | `test_clock_now_millis_is_wall_time` asserts ms magnitude ≈ Unix epoch, not a small monotonic counter |
| zbench branch breaks bench build | `zig-0.16.0` branch incompatible with our bench harness | `zig build bench` compile check (bench lane); fall back to a pinned commit or fork-branch |
| CI image SHA mismatch | Wrong/stale Zig SHA256 in `versions.env` | Image bake fails loud on checksum verify; no green CI until corrected |
| pg.zig master drift | Moving `master` ref breaks mid-PR | Pin the exact commit (not `#master`) per existing zon convention; bump deliberately |
| zig-yaml upstream changes shape | Re-vendor diverges from fork | `CHANGES.md` pins the exact upstream commit; vendored copy is verbatim + documented patch only |

---

## Invariants

1. **No wall-clock site bypasses the helper** — zero `std.time.milliTimestamp`/`nanoTimestamp` in `src/`. Enforced by the orphan-sweep tests (RULE ORP) run in CI, not by review.
2. **httpz UAF patch is present** — non-blocking `Worker.deinit` calls `thread_pool.stop()` before `thread_pool.deinit()`. Enforced by `test_httpz_worker_deinit_stops_pool` (a source/behaviour assertion), not by trusting the re-vendor.
3. **Single Zig-version source of truth** — `build.zig.zon` `minimum_zig_version`, `versions.env` `ZIG_VERSION`, and the CI image tags all read `0.16.0`. Enforced by `test_no_residual_0152_in_ci` + a version-consistency grep (RULE UFS).
4. **Cross-compile parity** — both `x86_64-linux` and `aarch64-linux` build (RULE XCC). Enforced by the cross-compile CI lane.
5. **No milestone IDs in source** — no `M82`/`§`/dim tokens in `.zig`/`.sh`/test names (RULE TST-NAM). Enforced by the milestone-ID audit.

## Test Specification (tiered)

| Dimension | Tier | Test | Asserts (concrete inputs → expected output) |
|-----------|------|------|---------------------------------------------|
| 1.1 | integration | `test_dep_graph_resolves_on_016` | `zig build --fetch` on 0.16 resolves all deps; `zig build` produces `zombied` |
| 1.2 | unit | `test_httpz_worker_deinit_stops_pool` | non-blocking `Worker.deinit` invokes `thread_pool.stop()` before `deinit()` (source/behaviour assertion) |
| 1.3 | unit | `test_yaml_frontmatter_parses_on_016` | a SKILL.md frontmatter fixture parses to expected JSON via the vendored `yaml` module |
| 1.4 | unit | `test_telemetry_init_compiles_with_io` | `preflight` builds + initialises posthog client with the v0.2.0 `io` arg; null-key path still disables cleanly |
| 2.1 | unit | `test_clock_now_millis_is_wall_time` | `nowMillis()` returns a value ≈ current Unix ms (> year-2020 threshold), `nowNanos()` ≈ ms×1e6 |
| 2.2 | unit (orphan) | `test_no_residual_milli_timestamp` | `git grep -c 'std.time.milliTimestamp' src/` == 0 |
| 2.3 | unit (orphan) | `test_no_residual_nano_timestamp` | `git grep -c 'std.time.nanoTimestamp' src/` == 0 |
| 2.4 | unit | `test_log_envelope_timestamp_via_clock` | a log emit carries a wall-clock `ts` field sourced from `clock`; envelope field set unchanged vs 0.15 baseline |
| 3.1 | integration | `test_builds_with_debug_allocator` | `zombied` builds with `DebugAllocator`; `make memleak` clean |
| 3.2 | unit | `test_fixed_writer_emits_expected_bytes` | each migrated `Io.Writer.fixed` site emits byte-identical output to its 0.15 `fixedBufferStream` baseline |
| 3.3 | unit | `test_hashmap_unmanaged_round_trip` | put/get/iterate over the migrated maps returns inserted entries |
| 3.4 | integration | `test_arraylist_016_api_compiles` | the full build compiles with the 0.16 ArrayList API |
| 4.1 | integration | `test_ci_images_pin_016` | `versions.env` `ZIG_VERSION==0.16.0`; baked image reports `zig version` 0.16.0 |
| 4.2 | unit (orphan) | `test_no_residual_0152_in_ci` | `grep -rn '0.15.2' .github/workflows playbooks/013_ci_zig_images` == 0 |
| 4.3 | integration | `test_cross_compile_both_linux_targets` | `zig build -Dtarget=x86_64-linux` && `-Dtarget=aarch64-linux` both exit 0 |
| 5.1 | unit (orphan) | `test_rule_zal_references_016` | RULES.md RULE ZAL contains no "0.15" ArrayList reference |

- **Regression:** the migration is behaviour-preserving — the full existing `make test` / `make test-integration` suite is the regression guard; it must pass unchanged on 0.16. Byte-level baselines for logging (2.4) and fixed-writer (3.2) protect the two surfaces where output shape could silently drift.
- **Idempotency/replay:** N/A — no retry semantics introduced.

## Discovery (consult log)

> **Empty at creation.** Append as work surfaces consults and decisions.

- **Spike origin:** feasibility proven on `spike/zig-0.16-feasibility` — full dep graph compiled on 0.16, only `main.zig` failed (3 mechanical renames). httpz UAF patch verified still-required on upstream `zig-0.16`. zig-yaml conformance-harness breakage discovered and forked. These findings are the basis for §1–§3.
- **CTO sequencing call (Jun 02, 2026):** spec authored PENDING, parked behind M80; not pulled into the active stream absent a forcing function (Overview). Rationale: no deadline, real churn, experimental upstream httpz 0.16 → no production risk taken to chase a version number.
- **Prerequisite verification (Jun 03, 2026) — both toolchain prerequisites resolved ahead of implementation:**
  - **zlint compatibility CONFIRMED.** zlint `v0.8.1` (the pin in `lint.yml`) parses Zig 0.16 grammar fine — `--print-ast` over all 575 real 0.16 files (full 0.16 std library recursively + the vendored 0.16 deps) returned **zero parse errors** (negative control verified the test catches real failures). 0.16 is a std-library reform, not a grammar change. No zlint fork or lane-gate needed; keep `ZLINT_VERSION: v0.8.1`. This removes the only out-of-our-control prerequisite.
  - **ci-zig 0.16.0 images BUILT + PUSHED.** All three `ghcr.io/usezombie/ci-zig-{alpine,debian-trixie,ubuntu}:0.16.0` are in GHCR (alpine multi-arch amd64+arm64). `playbooks/013_ci_zig_images/versions.env` bumped to 0.16.0 with authoritative ziglang.org SHAs (`x86_64-linux 70e49664…`, `aarch64-linux ea4b09bf…`) — that edit rides in `stash@{0}` with the rest of the foundation. §4 image-bake work is DONE; the workstream only needs to flip the `:0.15.2`→`:0.16.0` tags in the 9 workflows. Note: GHCR pushes were intermittently flaky (transient `DeadlineExceeded`/`connection reset` on the auth token) — each image took 1–2 retries; the cached layers make retries cheap.
- **Consults** — {Architecture / Legacy-Design / gate-flag triage: question + Indy's decision, as they arise.}
- **Skill chain outcomes** — {`/write-unit-test`, `/review`, `/review-pr`, `kishore-babysit-prs` results.}
- **Deferrals** — every "deferred to follow-up" needs an Indy-acked verbatim quote here.

## Skill-Driven Review Chain (mandatory)

| When | Skill | What it does | Required output |
|------|-------|--------------|-----------------|
| After implementation, before CHORE(close) | `/write-unit-test` | Audits diff coverage vs this Test Specification (orphan sweeps, byte-baselines, memleak). | Clean. Iteration count + coverage in Discovery. |
| After tests pass, before CHORE(close) | `/review` | Adversarial diff review vs this spec, `docs/ZIG_RULES.md`, Failure Modes, Invariants (esp. httpz patch + orphan completeness). | Clean OR every finding dispositioned. |
| After `gh pr create` | `/review-pr` | Review-comments the open PR against the immutable diff. | Comments addressed before human review/merge. |

## Out of Scope

- **`std.http.Client` rewrite → M82_002 (B2).** The 5 real call sites (`clerk_backend`, `jwks`, `control_plane_client`, `runner/daemon/loop`, `otel_logs`) are split into their own spec+PR because two cross the auth boundary — security-surface work does not ride a mechanical-cleanup diff. M82_002 depends on this workstream clearing.
- **Adopting `std.Io` as a first-class threaded dependency across the daemon** (vs the localized clock helper) — the larger refactor the 0.16 Io reform invites; future work, not triggered by toolchain currency.
- **Dropping the `httpz`/`zig-yaml` vendors** once upstream lands 0.16 fixes — a future re-pin; tracked in each `vendor/*/CHANGES.md`.
- **Bumping `VERSION` / changelog** — internal toolchain change, no user-visible behaviour; no `<Update>` entry.
