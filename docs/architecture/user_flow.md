# User Flow — how a user uses the system

> Parent: [`README.md`](./README.md)

Read this when you want to know how a real human gets from "I want an agent" to "the agent is running on my repo." The §-numbered subsections are stable anchors that other specs reference; do not rename them without sweeping cross-references.

The initial user assumption is simple:

- the user is already working inside Claude (or Amp, Codex CLI, OpenCode — any agent that can read SKILL.md)
- the user is already working on their own project or infrastructure
- the user wants operational work to continue without babysitting an endless terminal loop

The Claude session becomes the place where the user defines, installs, updates, and supervises agents. The agent runtime becomes the place where long-lived operational outcomes continue after the chat session ends.

For the full end-to-end install + first-trigger walkthroughs (platform-managed and self-managed), see [`scenarios/`](./scenarios/).

## §8.0 The wedge surface: `/usezombie-install-platform-ops` skill

The MVP's user-facing wedge is not raw `zombiectl install`. It is a host-neutral SKILL.md invoked as **`/usezombie-install-platform-ops`** — the same slash-command in every host (Claude Code, Amp, Codex CLI, OpenCode). One install procedure: drop the SKILL.md directory into the host's skills folder (`~/.claude/skills/usezombie-install-platform-ops/` or the host-equivalent path), or run the one-liner `curl -fsSL https://usezombie.sh | bash`, which installs `zombiectl` and adds the skill into the host path in one step (§8.2.1). No plugin manifest, no per-host packaging fork. The brand is in the slash-command itself; future skills follow the same pattern (`/usezombie-steer`, `/usezombie-doctor`).

The skill is the install UX; `zombiectl install --from <path>` is the substrate it drives.

What the skill does, in order:

1. **Detects the user's repo**: reads `.github/workflows/*.yml`, `fly.toml`, `Dockerfile`, `pyproject.toml`, `package.json` to infer CI provider, deploy target, and Slack channel. Bails clearly if no GitHub Actions workflow is detected (non-GH CI is post-MVP).
2. **Asks at most three or four gating questions** through the host-neutral `variables:` frontmatter (so the same SKILL.md works on Claude Code, Amp, Codex CLI, and OpenCode without `AskUserQuestion` lock-in). Slack channel, prod branch glob, and cron opt-in.
3. **Resolves credentials in order**: 1Password CLI (`op read`) → environment variables → interactive prompt. The skill never asks again for what `op` already has.
4. **Calls `zombiectl doctor --json` first** (see §8.2) to verify auth + workspace binding before any write.
5. **Generates `.usezombie/platform-ops/SKILL.md` and `.usezombie/platform-ops/TRIGGER.md`** in the user's repo with substituted values, refusing to overwrite without `--force`. These files are committed by the user — they are the configuration, version-controlled by design.
6. **Drives `zombiectl install --from .usezombie/platform-ops/`** then runs a batch `zombiectl steer {id} "morning health check"` smoke test.

This matters architecturally for two reasons. First, the skill artifact is portable — it is a markdown file, not a Claude-specific binary. The same wedge installs from any agent CLI that can read SKILL.md. Second, the skill is the only place where repo detection, secret resolution, and ≤4 question discipline are enforced. The runtime stays prompt-driven; the install UX is what makes the prompt-driven runtime tractable for a first-time user.

## §8.0.1 Deployment posture: hosted-only in v2

v2 ships **hosted-only** on `api.usezombie.com`. The skill detects no choice point: it defaults to the hosted endpoint, prompts Clerk OAuth via `zombiectl auth login` if the CLI is not authenticated, and proceeds. There is no self-host runbook in v2 and no `--self-host` flag.

This is a deliberate scope cut, not a gap in the architecture. The runtime is already structured so the auth substrate (Clerk OAuth), KMS adapter (cloud KMS), and process orchestration (Fly.io machines) are the only deployment-specific layers — the worker, runner, sandbox, event stream, and reasoning loop are all posture-agnostic. **Validating** that on a clean non-Fly Linux host (Clerk shim or local-token auth, a portable KMS adapter, the runner's Landlock+cgroups+bwrap on a vanilla VM, systemd orchestration) is a v3 workstream once v2 has earned the trust to justify the integration burden.

Practically, this means:

- v2 launch claim is **OSS + self-managed + markdown-defined**. Not "self-hostable."
- The `/self-host` runbook page does not exist on `docs.usezombie.com` for v2.
- Users who need self-host today are out of scope; the AI-infra / GPU-cloud / regulated mid-market personas in [`office_hours.md`](./office_hours.md) P1 are v3 customers, not v2.
- self-managed still ships in v2 — it sits on top of the hosted posture and removes the inference-cost lock-in independently of where the runtime runs. See [`capabilities.md`](./capabilities.md) and [`scenarios/02_self_managed.md`](./scenarios/02_self_managed.md).

## §8.1 Authoring the agent

The user defines the agent in project files:

- `SKILL.md` describes how the agent should think, what its job is, what "good" looks like, what evidence to gather, and what actions require caution. Plain English. No framework syntax.
- `TRIGGER.md` describes how the agent wakes up: webhook, cron, user steer, or a combination. Also declares `tools:`, `credentials:`, `network.allow:`, `budget:`, and `context:` knobs.

The user iterates those files from Claude in natural language:

- "tighten the deploy-failure diagnosis prompt"
- "add a periodic health check every 15 minutes"
- "require approval before teardown"
- "include Fly logs and Redis health in the first pass"

This keeps the operational logic editable by changing instructions, not by rewriting a typed workflow engine for every variation.

## §8.2 Installing the agent

Once the files are ready, the user installs the agent into the workspace.

### §8.2.1 Cold-machine bootstrap (run once per machine)

The canonical entry is the one-liner served from `https://usezombie.sh` — it wraps the first two steps below (install `zombiectl`, add the skill):

```bash
curl -fsSL https://usezombie.sh | bash   # installs zombiectl, then npx skills add usezombie/skills
```

Or run the chain explicitly (skip any step already in place):

```bash
npm install -g @usezombie/zombiectl     # CLI binary + bundled samples (postinstall copies to ~/.config/usezombie/samples/)
npx skills add usezombie/skills         # symlinks /usezombie-* into host skill paths (skills now ship from github.com/usezombie/skills)
zombiectl auth login                     # Clerk OAuth → token in ~/.config/usezombie/auth.json
gh auth login -s admin:repo_hook         # one-time; lets the install-skill register webhooks
```

The install-skill's first action (§8.2.2 step 1) is a `which zombiectl && which gh && zombiectl doctor --json` precondition check; on any miss it prints the explicit four-command block above and stops. The commands are deliberately separate so a user with most of the chain already in place skips what they already have.

### §8.2.2 Per-agent install flow

1. Claude (or another agent), typically driven by the `/usezombie-install-platform-ops` skill (§8.0), helps author or refine `SKILL.md` and `TRIGGER.md`.
2. **`zombiectl doctor --json` runs first** as the deterministic readiness gate after login. Doctor is auth-gated, fast, and verifies token validity, server reachability, an active workspace, workspace binding, tenant provider readiness, and (M68) free-trial state. The skill (and any future caller) reads `doctor`'s JSON output verbatim and aborts on failure with the user-facing message instead of letting `install` fail with a confusing 401. Doctor is the only sanctioned preflight surface — no parallel `preflight` command exists.
3. The user (or skill) installs or updates the agent through `zombiectl install --from <path>` or the dashboard install form at `/zombies/new`. Both surfaces POST `{trigger_markdown, source_markdown}` to `POST /v1/workspaces/{ws}/zombies`; the API parses frontmatter, derives `name` + `config_json`, persists the agent row, and synchronously creates the events stream + consumer group before returning 201. The 201 response carries `webhook_urls: { <source>: <url> }` — one entry per webhook trigger declared in `TRIGGER.md`. See [`data_flow.md`](./data_flow.md) for the install-to-lease sequence.
4. The API stores the agent config, linked credentials reference, approval policy, and trigger declarations (`triggers: [...]` array).
5. **Webhook registration on the upstream provider runs from the user's own machine** — the install-skill loops over webhook entries in the rendered TRIGGER.md and shells out to `gh api repos/.../hooks` (for GitHub) or the equivalent provider command, using the user's existing `gh` auth or stored API token. The platform never holds the user's PAT for this step; the registration is logged on the provider side by the user. For UI-only installs, the Trigger panel on `/zombies/{id}` renders the exact terminal command pre-filled with the webhook URL and event list, ready to copy.
6. Future triggers are served with no restart and no watcher thread: the install created the agent's events stream + consumer group up front (step 3), so each later trigger `XADD`s to `zombie:{id}:events` and the control plane hands that event to whichever `zombie-runner` leases next (`POST /v1/runners/me/leases`).

After install, the agent is no longer tied to the interactive Claude session that created it.

## §8.3 Triggering the agent

An agent's `TRIGGER.md` declares `triggers: [...]` — an array of 1–8 trigger entries (unique on `(type, source)` tuple). Each entry is one of:

- **Webhook trigger.** Type `webhook`, `source` from M28's `PROVIDER_REGISTRY` (`github`, `linear`, `jira`, `grafana`, `slack`, `agentmail`, `clerk`), and `events: [...]` listing the provider-specific subscriptions. An external system POSTs to `POST /v1/webhooks/{zombie_id}/{source}`. The receiver verifies the HMAC signature via M28's middleware (per provider), normalises the payload, and lands a synthetic event on `zombie:{id}:events` with `actor=webhook:<source>`.
- **Cron trigger.** Type `cron`, `schedule` as a 5-field cron expression. NullClaw's in-runner cron tool fires on time. Each fire arrives as a synthetic event with `actor=cron:<schedule>`. At most one cron entry per agent.

In addition to the declared triggers, every agent always accepts:

- **User steer.** The user, while in Claude, asks to run an operational task. Claude invokes `zombiectl steer {id} "<message>"` or types into the dashboard's chat composer on `/zombies/{id}`, which POSTs to `/v1/workspaces/{ws}/zombies/{id}/messages` and `XADD`s directly to `zombie:{id}:events` with `actor=steer:<user>` — the same single-ingress path webhook and cron use.

All actors flow through the same runtime path. The agent's reasoning loop does not branch on actor type — the same `http_request`-driven evidence gathering and Slack post happen regardless of how the work was triggered. The "morning health check" steer that ships as the install-time smoke test produces a real first-pass evidence sweep, not a canned response — the SKILL.md prose is what dictates behaviour, not the actor field.

`type: api` (catch-all JSON ingress at `POST /v1/zombies/{id}/events`) is reserved by the architecture but **not accepted in `TRIGGER.md` in v1** — admission lands with the workspace-API-tokens spec that builds the `/v1/auth/tokens` surface. Webhook and cron cover the wedge.

Beyond the three trigger ingresses, the runtime emits its own `system:*` events on the activity channel when state changes apply (`config_updated` after a PATCH reload; more kinds to follow). These are not triggers — they are the worker telling the user "what I just had to apply got applied" — see [`data_flow.md` §Synthetic system events](./data_flow.md#synthetic-system-events). They surface in the same activity tail and in `zombiectl events {id} --actor=system`, so the user sees them alongside the work the agent does.

## §8.4 Working from Claude or the dashboard

The user experience inside Claude (or Amp / Codex CLI / OpenCode) feels like this:

1. The user is already in their project.
2. The user asks Claude to create or refine an operational agent.
3. Claude edits `SKILL.md`, `TRIGGER.md`, and related project instructions.
4. Claude installs or updates the agent. The skill captures `webhook_urls` from the install response, parses the rendered `TRIGGER.md` for `triggers[].events`, and shells out to `gh api repos/.../hooks` per webhook trigger — registration happens without leaving the terminal.
5. Claude can also manually invoke the agent via `zombiectl steer` for one-off user-triggered tasks.
6. Later, the agent wakes on webhook or cron without the user staying in the terminal.
7. When the user returns to Claude, they inspect what happened from durable history (`zombiectl events {id}` or the dashboard Events tab) instead of reconstructing it from memory.

The dashboard equivalent surface on `/zombies/{id}` matches the CLI path:

- The **Trigger panel** renders one card per declared trigger. Known providers get a pre-rendered terminal command (e.g. `gh api repos/.../hooks ...` for GitHub, `curl https://api.linear.app/graphql ...` for Linear) the user copies and runs locally. The card shows the registered hook id and last delivery once a real event arrives. The dashboard never holds the user's provider PAT.
- The **chat surface** (composed via `@assistant-ui/react`) shows webhook / cron / continuation events as system chips, agent reasoning as streaming assistant bubbles, and the steer composer at the bottom turns user input into an event on the agent's stream.

This matters because the agent is not replacing Claude. It extends Claude from an interactive assistant into a durable operational worker — and the dashboard mirrors the same primitives so a user who lives in the browser sees an equivalent surface.

## §8.5 Example: Platform-Ops with GH Actions trigger

While working in Claude, the user defines a `platform-ops` agent that:

- wakes on GitHub Actions deploy-failure webhooks (primary)
- wakes on a periodic production health cron (secondary; declared in `triggers[]` or added by NullClaw's `cron_add` tool at runtime)
- can also be steered manually by the user

When a GH Actions deploy fails:

1. GitHub posts to the agent's webhook ingest URL `POST /v1/webhooks/{zombie_id}/github` with the failed `workflow_run` payload. The URL was registered earlier by the install-skill running `gh api repos/{repo}/hooks` from the user's machine; the platform never held the user's PAT for that step.
2. The webhook receiver verifies the HMAC signature against the workspace's stored credential (vault credential `github`, field `webhook_secret`). The credential is workspace-scoped — every agent in the workspace whose `triggers[]` contains a `source: github` entry shares it by default; rotating it once rotates everywhere. Resolver: `vault.loadJson(workspace_id, name=trigger.source)` (where `trigger` is the matching `triggers[]` entry); an optional `x-usezombie.triggers[].credential_name:` frontmatter override scopes a distinct vault row per agent for the per-agent credential-isolation case (multi-org GitHub, multi-app Slack, multi-tenant B2B-on-usezombie).
3. The receiver normalizes the payload into a synthetic event and `XADD`s to `zombie:{id}:events` with `actor=webhook:github`, `type=webhook`, `workspace_id={ws}`, `request={run_url, head_sha, conclusion, ref, repo, attempt}`, `created_at=<epoch_ms>`.
4. A `zombie-runner` long-polls `POST /v1/runners/me/leases`; on the lease path `zombied`:
   - INSERTs `core.zombie_events` (status='received')
   - passes the balance + approval gates
   - resolves credentials from the vault (GitHub PAT, Fly token, Slack bot token)
   - resolves provider config (`tenant_provider.resolveActiveProvider`) — platform-managed key OR self-managed key, depending on tenant posture
   - returns the lease carrying `secrets_map`, `network_policy`, `tools` list, `context` knobs, and provider config

   The runner then forks a sandboxed child that runs the NullClaw agent on the leased event.
5. The agent's NullClaw agent reasons over the message:
   - calls `http_request GET https://api.github.com/repos/{repo}/actions/runs/{run_id}/logs` with `${secrets.github.api_token}` substituted at the tool bridge
   - calls `http_request GET ${fly.host}/v1/apps/{app}/logs`
   - calls `http_request GET ${upstash.host}/v2/redis/stats/{db}`
   - correlates: was the failure a migration error vs OOM kill vs network timeout vs deploy-config drift
   - calls `http_request POST ${slack.host}/api/chat.postMessage` with the diagnosis
6. The agent's response is UPDATEd into `core.zombie_events` (status='processed', response_text, tokens, wall_ms).
7. If the SKILL.md prose said the agent may schedule a follow-up health check, it calls `cron_add "*/30 * * * *" "post-recovery health check"`.

When the user opens Claude later, they see the outcome trail in `core.zombie_events` keyed by actor — they can filter "show me all webhook:github events from the last 24h" or "show me what kishore steered last Tuesday." They never reconstruct from memory; the durable log is authoritative.

The same agent also responds to manual `zombiectl steer {id} "morning health check"` — same reasoning loop, different `actor=steer:kishore`.

## §8.6 Why Claude is the starting point

Starting with Claude is the right constraint because it matches how technical users already work today.

They are already:

- iterating prompts
- editing project docs
- asking for automation help
- supervising tools from the terminal

The v2 product meets them there first.

Later, other entrypoints exist (the dashboard chat widget, direct API calls). But the MVP assumes:

- the user authors and supervises from Claude
- the agent executes durably outside that transient chat session

## §8.7 Model and context-cap origin (platform vs. self-managed)

Two things travel together: the **model** the runner's agent invokes, and the **`context_cap_tokens`** L3 run chunking uses. They originate from different places under platform-managed and self-managed postures, and the control plane's overlay logic is what reconciles them at lease time.

The install-skill's job in both postures is the same shape: **call `zombiectl doctor --json` (auth-gated), read the `tenant_provider` block from doctor's response, branch on `mode`, write resolved-or-sentinel into frontmatter.** Doctor is the only sanctioned readiness check — it verifies the auth token is present, the CLI is bound to a tenant + workspace, and (extended in M48) returns the active provider posture. If `auth_token_present=false` the skill prints the `zombiectl auth login` hint and stops; the `tenant_provider` block is only meaningful once auth passes. The skill never calls the model-caps endpoint directly — doctor's block always carries resolved values (synth-default for tenants with no row, real values for tenants with an explicit row).

                → threshold = 0.75 × 200000               → threshold = 0.75 × 256000
```

**Overlay rule (per-field, independent, applied at lease time):** frontmatter `model: ""` OR `model:` key absent ⇒ overlay from `tenant_providers.model` (or synth-default if no row). Same rule for `context_cap_tokens: 0` OR absent. Non-empty / non-zero values respected as-is. The install-skill emits the *visible* sentinels (`""`, `0`) under self-managed posture so a human reading the frontmatter can spot at a glance that "this agent inherits from tenant config"; absent-key is the safety net for hand-edits.

The parser-side companion to this rule landed with M49: `x-usezombie.model` and `x-usezombie.context.*` are now first-class fields on `ZombieConfig`, carried on the lease as `ExecutionPolicy` / `ContextBudget` (`src/lib/contract/execution_policy.zig`) *before* auto-sentinel defaults are substituted. Frontmatter overrides therefore win against runtime defaults (the doc previously described this shape but the parser dropped the fields silently — now closed).

Single source of truth for caps: `https://api.usezombie.com/_um/da5b6b3810543fe108d816ee972e4ff8/model-caps.json`. Resolved at `tenant provider set` time (self-managed path) or hardcoded as a server-side synth-default constant (platform path). **Never resolved at trigger time** — would add a network dependency to the hot path. See [`billing_and_provider_keys.md`](./billing_and_provider_keys.md) §9 for the endpoint shape and [`scenarios/02_self_managed.md`](./scenarios/02_self_managed.md) for the full self-managed walkthrough.
